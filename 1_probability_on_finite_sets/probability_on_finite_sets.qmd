Despite its infamous reputation the foundations of probability theory are quite
straightforward.  Much of the mathematical difficulty arises only when we
implement probability theory on elaborate sets like the real numbers, and most
of the philosophical difficultly arises only when trying to assign an
interpretation to the mathematics.   In this chapter we will avoid this baggage
by introducing the basics of abstract probability theory on the simplest,
nontrivial set: a collection of a finite number of elements.

# Finite Sets

A **finite set** contains a finite number of distinct elements,
$$
X = \{x_1, ..., x_N\}.
$$
The numerical index here allows us to differentiate the between the $N$
individual elements but it does not necessarily imply that the elements have any
particular ordering to them.  To avoid any assumption of ordering I'll use the
five element set (@fig-ambient_set)
$$
X = \{\Box, \clubsuit, \diamondsuit, \heartsuit, \spadesuit\}
$$
for demonstration.

![A finite set contains a finite number of elements.  This particular set
contains five elements.](
figures/ambient_set/ambient_set){width=50% #fig-ambient_set}

In practical applications of probability theory the abstract elements $x_{n}$
will model meaningful objects, but in this chapter I will avoid any particular
interpretation and instead focus on the mathematical concepts.  That said when
$X$ is intended to capture _all_ of the objects of interest in a given
application I will refer to it as the **ambient set**.

Once we've defined an ambient set we have various ways of organizing its
individual elements and manipulating those organizations.

## Subsets

A **subset** of $X$ is any collection of elements in $X$.  To avoid any
ambiguity I will exclusively use lowercase roman letters $x$ to denote a
variable element in the ambient set $X$ and lowercase san serif letters
$\mathsf{x}$ to denote a variable subset.

For example $\mathsf{x} = \{\Box, \diamondsuit, \heartsuit\}$ is a subset of
$X = \{\Box, \clubsuit, \diamondsuit, \heartsuit, \spadesuit\}$ (@fig-subset).
Importantly there is no notion of multiplicity in the concept of a subset, just
membership: a subset can include an element $x_{n}$ but it cannot include it
multiple times.

![A subset $\mathsf{x} \subset X$ is any collection of elements from the
ambient set $X$.  Here $\mathsf{x} = \{\Box, \diamondsuit, \heartsuit\}$
contains just three of the five elements in
$X = \{\Box, \clubsuit, \diamondsuit, \heartsuit, \spadesuit\}$.](
figures/subset/subset){width=50% #fig-subset}

If $\mathsf{x}$ is a subset of the ambient set $X$ then we write
$\mathsf{x} \subset X$.  When $\mathsf{x}$ might contain all of the elements of
$X$, in which case $\mathsf{x} = X$, then we write $\mathsf{x} \subseteq X$.
Note that some authors use $\subset$ to refer to both circumstances, but I 
prefer the more precise notation.

Subsets are _recursive_ objects.  Selecting any elements from a subset yields a
new subset.  For example the collection $\{\diamondsuit, \heartsuit\}$ is a
subset of both the previously introduced subset,
$$
\{ \diamondsuit, \heartsuit \} \subset \{ \Box, \diamondsuit, \heartsuit \},
$$
and the full ambient set,
$$
\{ \diamondsuit, \heartsuit \} \subset X.
$$
More formally a subset $\mathsf{x}'$ is a subset of another subset $\mathsf{x}$
if and only if all of the elements in $\mathsf{x}'$ are also in $\mathsf{x}$.

Regardless of how many elements a finite set $X$ contains we can always construct
three special types of subsets.  The **empty set** $\emptyset = \{\}$ contains
no elements at all.  On the other hand the entire set itself can be considered
a subset containing all of the elements.  A subset containing a single element
is denoted $\{ x_{n} \}$ and referred to as an **atomic set**.

There are
$$
{N \choose n} = \frac{ N! }{ n! (N - n)!}
$$
ways to select $n$ elements from a finite set of $N$ total elements, and hence
${N \choose n}$ total subsets of size $n$.  For example there is only one subset
that contains no elements,
$$
{N \choose 0} = \frac{ N! }{ 0! (N - 0)!} = \frac{ N! }{ N! } = 1,
$$
which is just the empty set.  Similarly there is only one subset that contains
all of the elements,
$$
{N \choose N} = \frac{ N! }{ N! (N - N)!} = \frac{ N! }{ N! } = 1,
$$
which is just the full set itself.  On the other hand there are
$$
{N \choose 1} = \frac{ N! }{ 1! (N - 1)!} = N
$$
distinct atomics sets that contain a single element, one for each element in
$X$.

Counting all of the subsets of all possible sizes gives
$$
\sum_{n = 0}^{N} {N \choose n} = 2^{N}
$$
possible subsets that we can construct from a finite set with $N$ elements.
Those from a computer science background might recognize that this is 
equivalent to needed $N$ bits to specify each subset, one bit for the 
inclusion or exclusion of each element.


The collection of all subsets is itself a finite set with $2^{N}$ elements.  
We refer to this set as the **power set** of $X$ and denote it $2^{X}$.

When the ambient set, and all hence all of the possible elements that any
subset might contain, is fixed the prefix "sub" is sometimes dropped, with all
subsets simply referred to as sets.  For example collections of elements might
be denoted "sets" when one takes the ambient set for granted and "subsets"
when one wants to explicitly acknowledge the context of the ambient set.
Precise terminology, however, can vary strongly between disciplines and even
individuals.

## Subset Operations

We can always construct subsets element by element, but we can also construct
them by manipulating existing subsets.

For example given a subset $\mathsf{x} \subset X$ we can construct its
**complement** by collecting all of the elements in $X$ that are not already in
$\mathsf{x}$.  The atomic set $\mathsf{x} = \{ \diamondsuit \}$ contains the
lone element $\diamondsuit$ and its complement contains the remaining elements
(@fig-complement)
$$
\mathsf{x}^{c} = \{ \Box, \clubsuit, \heartsuit, \spadesuit \}.
$$
By construction the complement of the empty set is the entire set,
$\emptyset^{c} = X$, and the complement of the full set is the empty set,
$X^{c} = \emptyset$.

![The complement of a subset $\mathsf{x}$ is the subset $\mathsf{x}^{c}$
consisting of all elements in the ambient set that are not in $\mathsf{x}$.](
figures/complement/complement){width=75% #fig-complement}

More formally the construction of complementary subsets defines a _unary_
operation that takes in a subset as input and outputs the complementary subset,
\begin{alignat*}{6}
\cdot^c :\; & 2^X & &\rightarrow& \; & 2^X &
\\
& \mathsf{x} & &\mapsto& & \mathsf{x}^{c} &.
\end{alignat*}
The top line of this notation denotes the collection of all possible inputs and
outputs, here both the power set, while the bottom line denotes the action on
a particular input, here a subset mapped into its complement.  For example
applying the complement operator to the subset
$\mathsf{x} = \{ \clubsuit, \spadesuit \}$
gives
$$
\mathsf{x}^{c}
= \{ \clubsuit, \spadesuit \}^{c}
= \{ \Box, \diamondsuit, \heartsuit \}.
$$

We can also construct subsets from more than one subset.  Consider, for
example, two subsets $\mathsf{x}_1 = \{ \Box, \heartsuit \}$ and
$\mathsf{x}_2 = \{ \Box, \spadesuit \}$ (@fig-subsets).  The collection of all
elements that are contained in _either_ subset is itself a subset,
$$
\{ \Box, \heartsuit, \spadesuit \} \subset X,
$$
as is the collection of all elements that are contained only in _both_ subsets,
$$
\{ \Box \} \subset X.
$$
These derived subsets are referred to as the **union**,
$$
\mathsf{x}_1 \cup \mathsf{x}_2
= \{ \Box, \heartsuit \} \cup \{ \Box, \spadesuit \}
= \{ \Box, \heartsuit, \spadesuit \},
$$
and **intersection**,
$$
\mathsf{x}_1 \cap \mathsf{x}_2
= \{ \Box, \heartsuit \} \cap \{ \Box, \spadesuit \}
= \{ \Box \},
$$
respectively (@fig-ui).  Note that the union and intersection are both symmetric
in the sense that either order of the input subsets results in the same output
subset,
$$
\mathsf{x}_1 \cup \mathsf{x}_2 = \mathsf{x}_2 \cup \mathsf{x}_1
$$
and
$$
\mathsf{x}_1 \cap \mathsf{x}_2 = \mathsf{x}_2 \cap \mathsf{x}_1.
$$

![We can manipulate two subsets into a new subset in various ways.](
figures/overlapping_subsets/overlapping_subsets){width=75% #fig-subsets}

![The union of two subsets, $\mathsf{x}_1 \cup \mathsf{x}_2$, is a subset
containing all of the elements in either input subset.  On the other hand the
intersection of two subsets, $\mathsf{x}_1 \cap \mathsf{x}_2$, is a subset
containing just the elements that occur in both input subsets.](
figures/overlapping_subsets_ui/overlapping_subsets_ui){width=75% #fig-ui}

Two subsets are **disjoint** if they don't share any elements; in this case
their intersection is the empty set,
$$
\mathsf{x}_{1} \cap \mathsf{x}_{2} = \emptyset.
$$
The union and intersection of a subset with itself returns that subset,
$$
\mathsf{x} \cup \mathsf{x} = \mathsf{x} \cap \mathsf{x} = \mathsf{x}.
$$
Because the empty set does not contain any elements its union with any subset
returns back that subset,
$$
\mathsf{x} \cup \emptyset = \emptyset \cup \mathsf{x} = \mathsf{x},
$$
and its intersection with any subset returns the empty set,
$$
\mathsf{x} \cap \emptyset = \emptyset \cap \mathsf{x} = \emptyset.
$$
Similarly the union of any subset with the full set returns the full set,
$$
\mathsf{x} \cup X = X \cup \mathsf{x} = X,
$$
and the intersection of any subset with the full set returns back the subset,
$$
\mathsf{x} \cap X = X \cap \mathsf{x} = \mathsf{x}.
$$

Because they require two inputs the union and intersection define _binary_
operations that consume _two_ input subsets and return a single output subset,
\begin{alignat*}{6}
\cdot \cup \cdot :\; & 2^{X} \times 2^{X}& &\rightarrow& \; & 2^{X} &
\\
& \mathsf{x}_1, \mathsf{x}_{2} & &\mapsto& & \mathsf{x}_1 \cup \mathsf{x}_2 &
\end{alignat*}
and
\begin{alignat*}{6}
\cdot \cap \cdot :\; & 2^{X} \times 2^{X}& &\rightarrow& \; & 2^{X} &
\\
& \mathsf{x}_1, \mathsf{x}_{2} & &\mapsto& & \mathsf{x}_1 \cap \mathsf{x}_2 &.
\end{alignat*}
Here $2^{X} \times 2^{X}$ denotes the collection of all _pairs_ of subsets.

# Measure and Probability Over Elements

Measure theory, and its special case of probability theory, is often burdened
with intricate if not mysterious interpretations.  From a mathematical
perspective, however, measure theory simply concerns the consistent
**allocation** of some abstract quantity across the ambient set.

Consider a _reservoir_ of some positive, continuous, and _conserved_ quantity,
$M \in [0, \infty]$ (@fig-reservoir).  Because $M$ is conserved any amount
$m_{n}$ that is allocated to the element $x_{n} \in X$ has to be _depleted_ from
the reservoir, leaving less to be allocated to the remaining elements.

We have to be careful if the total content of the reservoir $M$ is infinite.
In this case we can allocate an infinite amount from the reservoir while still
having an infinite quantify left.  At the same time allocating an infinite
amount can depleting the reservoir completely or even leave any finite quantity.
Infinity is, at the very least, mathematically awkward.

![Measure theory concerns the allocation of some continuous and positive
quantity $M$ over the individual elements of the ambient set.](
figures/allocations/0/0){width=50% #fig-reservoir}

To make the mathematics as useful as possible we will avoid endowing $M$ with
any particular meaning for the time being.  Instead interpretations will arise
only when we use these allocations to _model_ meaningful systems.

An _exhaustive_ allocation of $M$ across the ambient set ensures that the
reservoir is completely emptied.  In another words all of $M$ has to be
allocated to the elements $x_{n} \in X$.

For example consider our demonstrative ambient set
$X = \{\Box, \clubsuit, \diamondsuit, \heartsuit, \spadesuit \}$.  If we
allocate $m_\Box$ to $\Box$ then that leaves $M - m_\Box$ remaining to allocate
to the other four elements (@fig-allocationa).  Allocating $m_\clubsuit$ to
$\clubsuit$ depletes the reservoir a bit more (@fig-allocationb).  At the end we
have to allocate all
$$
M - m_{\Box} - m_{\clubsuit} - m_{\diamondsuit} - m_{\heartsuit}
$$
that remains to $\spadesuit$ to completely empty the reservoir
(@fig-allocatione).

::: {#fig-allocation layout="[ [45, 45], [45, 45], [-22.5, 45, -22.5]]"}
![](figures/allocations/1/1){#fig-allocationa}

![](figures/allocations/2/2){#fig-allocationb}

![](figures/allocations/3/3){#fig-allocationc}

![](figures/allocations/4/4){#fig-allocationd}

![](figures/allocations/5/5){#fig-allocatione}

Because the total quantity $M$ is conserved every allocation $m_{n}$ to an
element $x_{n} \in X$ depletes the amount available for the allocation to the
remaining elements.  An exhaustive allocation leaves nothing left in the
initial reservoir after each element has received its allocation.
:::

A **measure** is any consistent allocation of the quantity $M$ to the elements
of an ambient set.  Mathematically any measure over a finite set can be
characterized by $N$ numbers (@fig-measure)
$$
\mu = \{ m_{1}, \ldots, m_{N} \}
$$
that satisfy
$$
0 \le m_{n}
$$
and
$$
\sum_{n = 1}^{N} m_{n} = M.
$$
For example any measure over the five-element set
$X = \{\Box, \clubsuit, \diamondsuit, \heartsuit, \spadesuit\}$ is specified by
any five positive numbers
$\{ m_\Box, m_\clubsuit, m_\diamondsuit, m_\heartsuit, m_\spadesuit \}$
satisfying
$$
m_\Box + m_\clubsuit + m_\diamondsuit + m_\heartsuit + m_\spadesuit = M.
$$

![A measure $\mu$ over the finite set $X$ is any consistent allocation of
$M$ to the elements $x_{n} \in X$.  Every measure can be characterized by
$N$ numbers $m_{n}$ that sum to $M$, or equivalently a function that maps each
element $x_{n}$ to its allocated measure $m_{n}$.](
figures/measure/measure){width=50% #fig-measure}

The larger $m_{n}$ the more of $M$ is allocated to the element $x_{n}$.
Following this terminology we will also refer to $M$ as the **total measure**
and $m_{n}$ as the **measure allocated to $x_{n}$**.

If the total measure in infinite, $M = \infty$, then at least one of the
elements in $X$ _has_ to receive an infinite allocation in order to empty the
reservior.  We can also consistently allocate infinite measure to multiple
elements, or even all of the elements, at the same time.  Infinite measures can
be very generous in their allocations.

The allocation $\{ x_{n}, m_{n} \}$ defined by a measure $\mu$ can also be
organized into a function that maps each element to its associated allocation,
\begin{alignat*}{6}
\mu :\; & X & &\rightarrow& \; & [0, \infty] &
\\
& x_{n} & &\mapsto& & m_{n} = \mu(x_{n}) &.
\end{alignat*}
A nice conceptual benefit of this functional perspective is that instead of
thinking about the global allocation $m_1, \ldots, m_N$ all at once we can
isolate local allocations by evaluating $\mu$ at only a single input
$m_{n} = \mu(x_{n})$.

In general there are an infinite number of ways to allocate a total measure to
the elements of a finite set, and hence an infinite number of measures that we
can define over that set.  I will denote the set of all possible measures over
$X$ as $\mathcal{M}(X)$.

Within this set there a few notable examples.  For example a
**singular measure** allocates the total measure $M$ to a single element,
leaving the rest with nothing (@fig-types_of_measurea).  On the other hand a
**uniform measure** allocates the same measure $M / N$ to each element
(@fig-types_of_measureb).  On finite sets there are $N$ distinct singular
measures, one for each distinct element, and a single unique uniform measure.

::: {#fig-types_of_measure layout="[ [45, 45] ]"}
![](figures/singular_measure/singular_measure){#fig-types_of_measurea}

![](figures/uniform_measure/uniform_measure){#fig-types_of_measureb}

A singular measure (a) allocates the total measure to a single element while
the uniform measure (b) spreads the total measure to each element evenly.
:::

Perhaps the most important class of measures, however, are measures where the
total measure is finite, $0 < M < \infty$.  Appropriately enough we refer to 
these as **finite measures**.

What makes finite measures so special is that we can always reframe the
allocation they define into a _relative_ one.  Instead of considering the
absolute measure allocated to each element $m_{n}$ we can consider the
_proportion_ of the total measure allocated to each element, (@fig-proportional)
$$
p_{n} = m_{n} / M.
$$
By construction proportions are confined to the unit interval $[0, 1]$.  As with
any quantity taking values in $[0, 1]$ we can represent proportions equally well
with decimals, for example $p_{n} = 0.2$, and percentages, $p_{n} = 20\%$.

![Every finite measure can be characterized by a proportional allocation.](
figures/proportional_measure/proportional_measure){width=50% #fig-proportional}

In other words a proportional measure defines the function (@fig-probability)
\begin{alignat*}{6}
\pi :\; & X & &\rightarrow& \; & [0, 1] &
\\
& x_{n} & &\mapsto& & p_{n} = \pi(x_{n}) &
\end{alignat*}
with
$$
0 \le p_{n} \le 1
$$
and
$$
\sum_{n = 1}^{N} p_{n} = 1.
$$
A collection of variables $\{ p_{1}, \ldots, p_{N} \}$ satisfying these
properties is referred to as a **simplex**.

![A proportional allocation is also known as a probability distribution.](
figures/probability_distribution/probability_distribution){
width=50% #fig-probability}

More importantly a proportional measure $\pi$ is also known as a
**probability distribution** with the proportional allocations $p_{n}$ denoted
**probabilities**.  While the term "probability" is often encumbered with all
kinds of interpretational and philosophical baggage its mathematical structure
is really quite straightforward: on a finite set a probability is just the
proportion of some finite quantity that is allocated to an individual element!

Philosophical tension arises only when we try to assign some meaning to these
proportional allocations.  This isn't a question of mathematics but rather
_applying_ mathematics to model a system of interest.  We'll come back to the
many different systems that can be consistently modeled with probability theory,
and hence the many different interpretations of probability itself, in
[Chapter 4](https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/chapters_html/probability_on_general_spaces.html).

While we're on the topic of terminological issues the word "distribution" is not
without its own problems.  In mathematics the term "distribution" is heavily
overloaded and can be used to refer to a variety of related but formally
distinct concepts.  One way to avoid confusion is to always refer to
proportional measures as "probability distributions" and never just
"distributions" alone.

# Measure and Probability Over Subsets

On finite sets any allocation, absolute or proportional, over the individual
elements $x \in X$ also defines an allocation over entire subsets
$\mathsf{x} \in 2^{X}$.  The measure allocated to a subset is just the sum of
the measures allocated to the elements in that subset.  For example the measure
allocated to $\mathsf{x} = \{ \Box, \clubsuit, \heartsuit \}$ is
$m_{\Box} + m_{\clubsuit} + m_{\heartsuit}$ (@fig-subset_measure).

![On a finite set an allocation over individual elements also defines an
allocation over any subset.](
figures/subset_measure/subset_measure){width=50% #fig-subset_measure}

In other words a measure over individual elements
$\mu : X \rightarrow [0, \infty]$ implicitly defines a measure over subsets
$\mu : 2^{X} \rightarrow [0, \infty]$.  Similarly a probability distribution
over individual elements $\pi : X \rightarrow [0, 1]$ implicitly defines a
probability distribution over subsets $\pi : 2^{X} \rightarrow [0, 1]$.

Note that we have made the cardinal sin of _overloading_ our notation so that
$\mu$ refers to both types of measures, and the only way to differentiate them
is through their different inputs; $\mu(x)$ denotes the element-wise measure
allocated to $x \in X$ and $\mu( \mathsf{x} )$ denotes the subset-wise measure
allocated to $\mathsf{x} \in 2^X$.  Maintaining different typographical
conventions for elements and subsets is critical to avoid any confusion when
overloading notation like this.

By construction any subset measure and probability distribution satisfy a wealth
of useful properties.  For example for any measure
$$
\mu( \emptyset ) = 0
$$
and
$$
\mu( X ) = \sum_{n = 1}^{N} \mu(x_{n}) = M,
$$
while for any probability distribution we have $\pi( \emptyset ) = 0$ and
$\pi( X ) = 1$.

Even better the subset allocations play well with the subset operations.
Consider for example the two disjoint subsets
$\mathsf{x}_{1} = \{ \Box, \diamondsuit \}$ and
$\mathsf{x}_{2} = \{ \clubsuit, \spadesuit \}$.  Because the two subsets are
disjoint their union simply combines all of their elements,
$$
\mathsf{x}_{1} \cup \mathsf{x}_{2}
=
\{ \Box, \diamondsuit \} \cup \{ \clubsuit, \spadesuit \}
=
\{ \Box, \clubsuit, \diamondsuit, \spadesuit \},
$$
and the measure of that union is just the sum of the measures of the input
subsets,
\begin{align*}
\mu ( \mathsf{x}_{1} \cup \mathsf{x}_{2} )
&=
\mu ( \{ \Box, \clubsuit, \diamondsuit, \spadesuit \} )
\\
&=
m_{\Box} + m_{\clubsuit} + m_{\diamondsuit} + m_{\spadesuit}
\\
&=
( m_{\Box} + m_{\diamondsuit} ) + ( m_{\clubsuit} + m_{\spadesuit} )
\\
&=
\mu( \mathsf{x}_{1} ) + \mu( \mathsf{x}_{2} ).
\end{align*}

More generally for any collection of subsets
$$
\mathsf{x}_{1}, \ldots, \mathsf{x}_{K}
$$
that are mutually disjoint,
$$
\mathsf{x}_{k} \cap \mathsf{x}_{k'} = \emptyset
$$
for $k \ne k'$, we have
$$
\mu ( \cup_{k = 1}^{K} \mathsf{x}_{k} )
=
\sum_{k = 1}^{K} \mu ( \mathsf{x}_{k} ).
$$
In words if we can decompose a subset into a disjoint collection of smaller
subsets then we can also decompose the measure allocated to that initial subset
into measures allocated to the component subsets.  This consistency property is
known as **additivity**.

A subset $\mathsf{x}$ and its complement $\mathsf{x}^{c}$ always disjoint,
$\mathsf{x} \cap \mathsf{x}^{c} = \emptyset$.  At the same time their union
covers the entire set, $\mathsf{x} \cup \mathsf{x}^{c} = X$.  Consequently
additivity implies that
\begin{align*}
M
&=
\mu (X)
\\
&=
\mu ( \mathsf{x} \cup \mathsf{x}^{c} )
\\
&= \mu ( \mathsf{x} ) + \mu ( \mathsf{x}^{c} ),
\end{align*}
or
$$
\mu ( \mathsf{x}^{c} ) = M - \mu ( \mathsf{x} ).
$$
In words the measure allocated to the complement of a subset is the total
measure less the measure allocated to that subset.  For probability
distributions this becomes even cleaner,
$$
\pi ( \mathsf{x}^{c} ) = 1 - \pi ( \mathsf{x} ).
$$

When two subsets overlap we have to take into consideration that the sum of
their measures $\mu ( \mathsf{x}_{1} ) + \mu ( \mathsf{x}_{2} )$ double counts
the allocations to any elements shared between them.  For example if
$\mathsf{x}_{1} = \{ \Box, \heartsuit \}$ and
$\mathsf{x}_{2} = \{ \Box, \spadesuit \}$ then the union includes the
overlapping element $\Box$ only once,
$$
\mathsf{x}_{1} \cup \mathsf{x}_{2}
=
\{ \Box, \heartsuit \} \cup \{ \Box, \spadesuit \}
=
\{ \Box, \heartsuit, \spadesuit \}.
$$
Consequently
\begin{align*}
\mu( \mathsf{x}_{1} \cup \mathsf{x}_{2} )
&=
\mu( \{ \Box, \heartsuit, \spadesuit \} )
\\
&=
m_{\Box} + m_{\heartsuit} + m_{\spadesuit}.
\end{align*}
Adding the measures allocated to the two subsets individually, however, gives
\begin{align*}
\mu( \mathsf{x}_{1} ) + \mu ( \mathsf{x}_{2} )
&=
(m_{\Box} + m_{\heartsuit} ) + ( m_{\Box} + m_{\spadesuit} )
\\
&=
m_{\Box} + m_{\Box} + m_{\heartsuit} + m_{\spadesuit}
\\
&=
m_{\Box} + \mu( \mathsf{x}_{1} \cup \mathsf{x}_{2} ).
\end{align*}

The element that is double counted here, however, is exactly the lone element in
the intersection of the two subsets (@fig-overlapping_subsets_measures),
$$
m_{\Box} = \mu( \{ \Box \} ) = \mu( \mathsf{x}_{1} \cap \mathsf{x}_{2} ).
$$
In other words we can write
$$
\mu( \mathsf{x}_{1} ) + \mu ( \mathsf{x}_{2} )
=
  \mu( \mathsf{x}_{1} \cap \mathsf{x}_{2} )
+ \mu( \mathsf{x}_{1} \cup \mathsf{x}_{2} ).
$$
This relationship is quite general and holds for _any_ two subsets regardless
of their overlap.

![When two subsets overlap the measure allocated to each double counts the
measure allocated to any overlapping elements, here $\Box$, but the measure
allocated to their union does not.  This results in an important relationship
between the measures allocated to the two subsets, the measure allocated to
their union, and the measure allocated to their intersection.](
figures/overlapping_subsets_measures/overlapping_subsets_measures){
width=75% #fig-overlapping_subsets_measures}

These subset properties allow us to build up a given measure in many different
ways, each of which can useful in different circumstances.  This provides
convenient flexibility when trying to apply measure theory and probability
theory in practice.

For example we can always specify a measure _globally_ by specifying the
individual allocations at the same time (@fig-all_at_once).  Alternatively we
can specify the allocation _locally_ by allocating measure to each element one
at a time (@fig-one_at_a_time).

![Measures can be constructed by specifying the individual element allocations
all at once.](
figures/decompositions/all_at_once/all_at_once){
width=33% #fig-all_at_once}

![At the same time measures can be constructed by specifying the individual
element allocations one by one.](
figures/decompositions/one_at_a_time/one_at_a_time){
width=100% #fig-one_at_a_time}

Critically we do not always need to start with individual allocations.  Instead
we can always start by allocating the total measure to disjoint subsets and then
iteratively _refining_ that allocation to smaller and smaller subsets until we
reach the individual elements (@fig-refinement).

![Measures can also be constructed by allocating the total measure to disjoint
subsets and then iteratively refining that allocation to smaller and smaller
subsets.](

width=100% #fig-refinement}

In addition to providing flexible constructions the subset definition of a
measure $\mu : 2^{X} \rightarrow [0, \infty]$ is also critical for generalizing
measure theory beyond finite sets.  Specifically it becomes _necessary_ when
trying to consistently define measures on more mathematically complicated sets
like the real line.  This will be the topic of [Chapter 4](https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/chapters_html/probability_on_general_spaces.html).
