Previously in
[Chapter One](https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/chapters_html/probability_on_finite_sets.html)
we introduced measure and probability theory over sets with only a
finite number of elements.  We saw in
[Chapter Two](https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/chapters_html/spaces.html),
however, that many of the most mathematical spaces we encounter in
practical applications, like the integers and the real line, feature not
a finite number of elements but rather countably infinite and even
uncountably infinite numbers of elements.  Unfortunately extending
measure and probability theory to more general spaces like these is not
always straightforward.

In this chapter we will investigate the difficulties in defining measure
and probability theory on general mathematical spaces, with a focus on
concepts instead of technical details.  We will first discuss why
measures allocated to individual elements does not, in general, provide
enough information to define a consistent allocation for all subsets.
Then we will consider how certain pathological subsets on some spaces
can obstruct consistent allocations over the full power set, and how we
can systematically remove these obstructions in practice.  Finally we
will present the most general form of measure and probability theory
that can be applied to any mathematical space and then discuss some
common applications.

# Allocation Over Elements

Recall that in
[Chapter One](https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/chapters_html/probability_on_finite_sets.html)
we first defined measures and probability distributions as allocations
over the individual elements in a finite set.  More formally we were
able to define a measure as a function that mapped each element to its
allocation of the total measure,
\begin{alignat*}{6}
\mu :\; & X & &\rightarrow& \; & [0, \infty] &
\\
& x & &\mapsto& & \mu(x) &.
\end{alignat*}

This element-wise allocation then allowed us to define the measure
allocated to subsets.  In particular the measure allocated to a subset
$\mathsf{x} \subset X$ was unambiguously determined by summing up the
measures allocated to the included elements,
$$
\mu(\mathsf{x}) = \sum_{x \in \mathsf{x}} \mu(x).
$$
On finite spaces this construction gives us a _consistent_ allocation in
the sense that the total measure is always preserved no matter how we
might decompose the ambient set into subsets.

Conveniently this construction does extend to spaces with countably
infinite numbers of elements, such as the integers.  In these spaces
every subset contains at most a countably infinite number of elements
and sums of measures will always converge to well-defined values.
Element-wise measure allocations on finite and countably infinite spaces
are also known as **mass functions**, with element-wise probability
allocations also known as **probability mass functions**.

Mass functions are particularly straightforward to visualize when $X$
is not only countable but also ordered, such as the integers or a subset
of the integers.  In this case we can visualize the element-wise
allocations with a sequence of vertical bars stacked next to each other
(@fig-mass-function).

![On countable, ordered spaces we can visualize mass functions with
a sequence of vertical bars representing the amount of measure allocated
to each individual element.](
figures/mass_function/mass_function){
width=80% #fig-mass-function}

Unfortunately the element-wise construction does not extend any further.
Once we consider spaces with uncountably infinite numbers of elements,
such as the real numbers, we have to confront subsets with uncountably
infinite numbers of elements where sums start to misbehave.

Consider for example a subset $\mathsf{x}$ where each of the included
elements has been allocated exactly zero measure.  If $\mathsf{x}$
contains only a finite or countably infinite number of elements then
the sum of these zero measures _always_ yields zero.

When $\mathsf{x}$ contains an uncountably infinite number of elements,
however, the sum of the individual element measures is not necessarily
zero.  In fact it can give _any_ value between zero and infinity;
uncountably infinite spaces have so many elements that we can very much
get something from nothing!

Ultimately this means that on general spaces the allocation of measure
to individual elements _does not provide enough information_ to uniquely
determine what measure should be allocated to every combination of those
elements.  In order to completely define a measure we need to specify
what those subset allocations are ourselves.

# Allocation Over All Subsets

In
[Chapter One](https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/chapters_html/probability_on_finite_sets.html)
we also considered defining a measure by specifying allocations to each
subset in the power set,
\begin{alignat*}{6}
\mu :\; & 2^{X} & &\rightarrow& \; & [0, \infty] &
\\
& \mathsf{x} & &\mapsto& & \mu(\mathsf{x}) &.
\end{alignat*}
Importantly these subsets allocations needed to be consistent with each
other to match the behavior of those derived from individual element
allocations.  For any finite collection of _disjoint_ subsets we should
have
$$
\mu( \cup_{i = 1}^{I} \mathsf{x} )
=
\sum_{i = 1}^{I} \mu( \mathsf{x}_{i}).
$$

For finite spaces this construction is excessive; the subset allocations
contain an abundance of redundant information.  Because we also can
derive subset allocations from element-wise allocations on countably
infinite spaces, this construction is unnecessary there as well.

On the other hand at least some subset allocation is strictly necessary
for fully defining measures on uncountably infinite spaces, and hence
mathematical spaces in general.  The only question is whether or not
_consistent_ subset allocations are even possible on these more
sophisticated spaces.

## Consistent Allocations

Before answering this question let's take a second to define exactly
what kind of consistency we need.  Because finite spaces feature only a
finite number of subsets we only ever have to consider the consistency
of a finite collection of subsets at a time.  More formally if
$$
\{ \mathsf{x}_{1}, \ldots, \mathsf{x}_{i}, \ldots, \mathsf{x}_{I} \}
$$
is any finite collection of disjoint subsets,
$$
\mathsf{x}_{i} \cap \mathsf{x}_{i' \ne i} = \emptyset,
$$
then a consistent measure should give
$$
\mu( \cup_{i = 1}^{I} \mathsf{x} )
=
\sum_{i = 1}^{I} \mu( \mathsf{x}_{i}).
$$
Regardless of how many elements the ambient space contains, consistency
of a measure over any finite collection of subsets is known as
**finite additivity**.

More general spaces can feature infinitely many subsets, and hence
different possible notions of additive consistency.  For example on a
countably infinite space the subset allocations derived from a mass
function are consistent across countably infinite collections of
subsets.  If
$$
\{ \mathsf{x}_{1}, \ldots, \mathsf{x}_{i}, \ldots \}
$$
is any countably infinite collection of disjoint subsets with
with
$$
\mathsf{x}_{i} \cap \mathsf{x}_{i' \ne i} = \emptyset
$$
then
$$
\mu( \cup_{i} \mathsf{x} )
=
\sum_{i} \mu( \mathsf{x}_{i}).
$$
This is known as **countable additivity**.

The question is then whether measures with finite additivity are
sufficiently useful for practical application or if we need to consider
countably additive measures, let alone measures that might be additive
over even larger collections of subsets.

For example a common problem that arises in practice is reconstructing
the measure allocated to a general subset from the measures allocated to
particularly nice subsets that are easier with which to work.  If we
could always decompose a generic subset into the disjoint union of a
finite number of nice subsets then finite additivity would be
sufficient for this task.  On the other hand if we could decompose a
generic subset into the disjoint union of only a countably infinite
number of nice subsets then countable additivity would be sufficient.
Potentially some subsets might be decomposable only into an uncountably
infinite number of subsets in which case we would need even stronger
notions of additivity!

Fortunately for us we don't have to go to that last extreme.  It turns
out that on most spaces that we'll encounter in practice, and typical
notions of "nice" subsets, countable additivity is sufficient for
reconstructing the measure allocated to more general subsets.

To demonstrate let's consider the two-dimensional real plane
$\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and a measure that is partially defined through it's
allocations to **rectangular** subsets (@fig-disk-decomposition).  In
general a non-rectangular subset, in this case a disk, can be crudely
approximated by a single rectangular subset.  The disk can be
approximated more precisely as the disjoint union of many different
rectangular subsets, but that will never exactly reconstruct the disk.
Only when we incorporate a countably infinite number of rectangular
subsets can we reconstruct the disk without any error.

![On a two-dimensional real plane $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ a non-rectangular
disc can be approximated, but not exactly reconstructed, by the finite
union of different rectangular subsets.  In order to exactly reconstruct
a non-rectangular subset we need to include a countably infinite number
of rectangular subsets.  If measures are countably additive then we can
use this decomposition to reconstruct the measure allocated to the disk
by adding up the measures allocated to the infinitely many rectangular
subsets in the reconstruction.](
figures/disk_decomposition/disk_decomposition){
width=90% #fig-disk-decomposition}

Ultimately countable additive measures give us the mathematical
flexibility we need for many practical applications.

## Sub-Additivity and Super-Additivity

Ideally we would be able to define measures that are additive over any
countably infinite collection of disjoint subsets on any space.
Unfortunately mathematics is not always kind, and many seemingly
well-behaved space feature pathological subsets that obstruct countable
additivity.

Specifically many uncountably infinite spaces feature disjoint subsets
that will always behave **sub-additivity**,
\begin{align*}
\mathsf{x}_{1} \cup \mathsf{x}_{2} &= \emptyset
\\
\mu( \mathsf{x}_{1} \cup \mathsf{x}_{2} )
&<
\mu( \mathsf{x}_{1}) + \mu( \mathsf{x}_{2} )
\end{align*}
no matter how we try to define the allocation!  In other words the power
set will always be infiltrated by certain subsets that are always less
than the sum of their parts and obstruct a consistent definition of
measure.

At the same time we can generally show that there exist disjoint subsets
that are **super-additive**,
\begin{align*}
\mathsf{x}_{1} \cup \mathsf{x}_{2} &= \emptyset
\\
\mu( \mathsf{x}_{1} \cup \mathsf{x}_{2} )
&>
\mu( \mathsf{x}_{1}) + \mu( \mathsf{x}_{2} ).
\end{align*}
In other words if the measure allocated to these subsets and the measure
allocated to their union then we will always appear to end up with
measure than what had been initially allocated.

What makes these pathological subsets even more awkward is that we can't
actually construct them from explicit conditions.  Given typical
assumptions about infinity all we can do is prove that these subsets
exist.  These phantom subsets are known as **non-constructive** objects.

That said because the misbehaving subsets are non-constructive we don't
really need to consider them in any practical application of measure
theory.  If we could consistently filter them out of the full power set
then we would be able to define consistent measures over the remaining
subsets, and that would be sufficient for any practical application.

# [$\sigma$]{style="text-transform:none;"}-Algebras

Because the term "$\sigma$-algebra" is often thrown around in measure
and probability theory without much explanation it is often seen as an
impenetrable concept that defies explanation.  In reality, however,
$\sigma$-algebra are simply a way to consistently filter out subsets
from the power set.

## Filtering Subsets

We can always filter the power set by removing certain subsets.  The
difficultly is ensuring that no application of the three set operations
would ever lead us back to the excised subsets and reveal a "hole" in
the remaining collection of subsets.  In other words we need our
filtered collection of subsets to be _closed_ under the three set
operations so that there is no risk of accidentally recreating a subset
outside of the collection.

In particular if the subset $\mathsf{x} \subset X$ is in our filtered
collection then so too should be the complement $\mathsf{x}^{c}$.  If
this is true then anytime we apply the complement operator to a subset
in our collection we are guaranteed to always see another subset in
our collection.

Similarly for every pair of subsets $\mathsf{x}_{1} \subset X$ and
$\mathsf{x}_{2} \subset X$ in a filtered collection the union
$\mathsf{x}_{1} \cup \mathsf{x}_{2}$ and intersection
$\mathsf{x}_{1} \cap \mathsf{x}_{2}$ should also be in the collection.
In order to ensure closure under repeated applications of the union and
intersection operators we need the union and intersection of any
countably infinite sequences of subsets to also be in the filtered
collection.

A **$\sigma$-algebra** is any collection of subsets that is closed under
complements, countable unions, and countable intersections.  In other
words a $\sigma$-algebra is just any consistent filtering of the power
set.  I will use a calligraphic font to refer to $\sigma$-algebras
so that if $X$ is a space then $\mathcal{X} \subset 2^{X}$ will denote a
$\sigma$-algebra defined on that space.

A set equipped with a $\sigma$-algebra, $(X, \mathcal{X})$ is known as a
**measurable space**.  I will refer to $X$ as the **ambient set**, or
the **ambient space** if it is also equipped with additional structure.
Similarly the elements of a $\sigma$-algebra are known as
**measurable subsets** while any subsets in the power set but not in the
$\sigma$-algebra are referred to as **non-measurable** subsets.

When non-measurable subsets are misbehaving subsets they reveal the
subtle, and often counterintuitive, pathologies inherent to that space.
By working with $\sigma$-algebras directly we can avoid these awkward
pathologies entirely.

## Generating [$\sigma$]{style="text-transform:none;"}-Algebras

Now that we've defined how a consistent sub-collection of subsets
behaves we need to consider how to construct these $\sigma$-algebras in
practice.  One particularly useful way to build up $\sigma$-algebras is
to _generate_ them by repeatedly applying the three set operations to an
initial collection of subsets.

For example consider an initial collection of two subsets
$$
\{ \mathsf{x}_1, \mathsf{x}_2 \}.
$$
Applying the complement operator gives us two subsets that fall outside
of the initial collection,
$$
\{ \mathsf{x}_1^c, \mathsf{x}_2^c \},
$$
Similarly applying the union operator gives
$$
\{ \mathsf{x}_1 \cup \mathsf{x}_2 \}
$$
while applying the intersection operator gives
$$
\{ \mathsf{x}_1 \cap \mathsf{x}_2 \}.
$$
To ensure closure we have to add _all_ of these subsets to our initial
collection,
$$
\{ \mathsf{x}_1, \mathsf{x}_2, \mathsf{x}_1^c, \mathsf{x}_2^c,
   \mathsf{x}_1 \cup \mathsf{x}_2, \mathsf{x}_1 \cap \mathsf{x}_2 \}.
$$
At this point we iterate, applying the complement operator to every
subset and the union and intersection operators to every finite and
countably infinite sub-collection of subsets to generate an even larger
collection of subsets.  When the set operations no longer return new
subsets the final collection of subsets defines a $\sigma$-algebra.

A convenient feature of this procedure is that if we start with a
collection of constructive subsets then we will _always_ end up with a
$\sigma$-algebra that is free of any non-constructive subsets and their
pathological behaviors.  To ensure that we don't filter out any
well-behaved subsets in the process we just have to make sure that our
initial collection is sufficiently large.

Conveniently when working on a topological space we already have a
natural collection of subsets that we can use to generate a
$\sigma$-algebra -- the defining topology itself!  The $\sigma$-algebra
generated by repeatedly applying all three set operations to the subsets
in a topology is known as a **Borel** $\sigma$-algebra.  In other words
a Borel $\sigma$-algebra is the unique $\sigma$-algebra comprised of all
of the open and closed subsets.  If $X$ is a topological space then I
will denote the corresponding Borel $\sigma$-algebra by
$\mathcal{B}_{X}$.

Every space that we will consider in this book will be a topological
space.  Consequently we can always use the corresponding Borel
$\sigma$-algebra to remove any undesired subsets that might obstruct the
definition of a consistent measures and probability distributions.
Indeed Borel $\sigma$-algebras are so common that they are often take
for granted, with any reference to a "measurable space" implicitly
assuming a topological space and its corresponding Borel
$\sigma$-algebras to filter out any inconsistent behavior.

For example finite and countably infinite spaces are almost always
equipped with discrete topologies.  Because discrete topologies contain
all of the atomic sets the $\sigma$-algebras derived from them will
always be the full power set.  In these cases there are no pathological
behaviors that we have to avoid at all!  I will refer to any measurable
space $(X, 2^{X})$ compatible with a discrete topology as
**discrete measurable spaces**.

On the other hand the Borel $\sigma$-algebra derived from the
topology that defines the real line filters out all of the
non-constructive subsets and their undesired behaviors while keeping all
of the interval subsets and the subsets that we can derive from them.
This results in a $\sigma$-algebra that is strictly smaller than the
full power set of the real line.

## Measurability Is Not Recursive

A potentially counterintuitive feature of general $\sigma$-algebras is
that the subsets of a measurable subset need not themselves be
measurable.  For example the intervals that are measurable with respect
to the Borel $\sigma$-algebra over a real line contain many non-Borel
measurable subsets.

This behavior doesn't really have any practical consequence, but it can
frustrate many formal proofs and derivations.  Consequently when
engaging in more technical calculations it can be helpful to expand a
given $\sigma$-algebra so that the subsets of certain measurable subsets
are always guaranteed to be measurable as well; see for example the
discussions at the end of [Section 4.3](@sec:null) and
[Section 5.2](@sec:lebesgue).

If we add subsets to a $\sigma$-algebra then we also have to add the
subsets that are generated from complements, unions, and intersections.
Fortunately there is a systematic construction for this process that
ensures a valid $\sigma$-algebra.  This means that in more applied
practice we can always safely assume a Borel $\sigma$-algebra or any
extension of that $\sigma$-algebra that might be needed to resolve any
technical issues.

# Measures and Probability Distributions

With all of that work we are finally ready to define a theory for
allocating any conserved, but not necessarily finite, quantity across
a general mathematical space.

## Formal Definitions

A **measure** on any measurable space $(X, \mathcal{X})$ is a function
from the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{X}$ to the extended positive real
line,
\begin{alignat*}{6}
\mu :\; & \mathcal{X} & &\rightarrow& \; & [0, \infty] &
\\
& \mathsf{x} & &\mapsto& & \mu(\mathsf{x}) &,
\end{alignat*}
that is **countably additive**,
$$
\mu( \cup_{i} \mathsf{x} ) = \sum_{i} \mu( \mathsf{x}_{i} )
$$
for any countably infinite collection of subsets
$$
\{ \mathsf{x}_{1}, \ldots, \mathsf{x}_{i}, \ldots \}
$$
that are mutually disjoint,
$$
\mathsf{x}_{i} \cap \mathsf{x}_{i' \ne i} = \emptyset.
$$

On finite and countably infinite spaces we can always take
$\mathcal{X} = 2^{X}$ and ensure countable additivity by allocating
measure to individual elements and then deriving the measure allocated
to subsets by summing over the measure allocated to the included
elements.  When working with more sophisticated ambient spaces, however,
the pair $(X, 2^{X})$ may not admit _any_ consistent measures.  In these
cases we have to consider smaller $\sigma$-algebras in order for
measures to exist.

A set equipped with not only a $\sigma$-algebra but also a measure,
in other words the triple $(X, \mathcal{X}, \mu)$ is known as a
**measure space**.  Again  I will refer to $X$ as the ambient set or
ambient space as appropriate.

If the total measure is finite, $\mu(X) < \infty$, then $\mu$ is
referred to as a **finite measure**.  In this case we can always
normalize the measure by $\mu(X)$ to define a proportional allocation.

A **probability distribution** (@fig-distribution) on any measurable
space $(X, \mathcal{X})$ is a function from the $\sigma$-algebra
$\mathcal{X}$ to the closed unit interval,
\begin{alignat*}{6}
\pi :\; & \mathcal{X} & &\rightarrow& \; & [0, 1] &
\\
& \mathsf{x} & &\mapsto& & \pi(\mathsf{x}) &,
\end{alignat*}
with
$$
\pi(X) = 1
$$
and
$$
\pi( \cup_{i} \mathsf{x} ) = \sum_{i} \pi( \mathsf{x}_{i} )
$$
for any countably infinite collection of subsets
$$
\{ \mathsf{x}_{1}, \ldots, \mathsf{x}_{i}, \ldots \}
$$
that are mutually disjoint,
$$
\mathsf{x}_{i} \cap \mathsf{x}_{i' \ne i} = \emptyset.
$$
These properties are also known collectively as the
**Kolmogorov axioms**.

![A probability distribution defines a proportional allocation across
a measurable space such that no matter how we slice up the ambient set
$X$ into measurable subsets the total probability is always preserved.](
figures/distribution/distribution){
width=75% #fig-distribution}

A set equipped with a $\sigma$-algebra and a probability distribution is
known as a **probability space**.  Sometimes the combination
$(X, \mathcal{X}, \pi)$ is also known as a **probability triple**.

Probability spaces are also sometimes denoted by
$$
x \sim \pi,
$$
where $x \in X$ indicates the ambient set and a $\sigma$-algebra is
taken for granted.  In words this reads "the variable $x$ is distributed
according to $\pi$" or "the variable $x$ follows the distribution
$\pi$".  That said because probability distributions are generally
defined over measurable subsets and not individual elements a more
precise description be would be "the variable $x$ takes values in a set
$X$ that is equipped with a probability distribution $\pi$".  The
emphasis on variables instead of spaces in this notation is related to
the awkward notion of a "random variable" which we will discuss in more
detail in Chapter Ten.

From a mathematical perspective probability distributions are just
special cases of measures.  That special case, however, is uniquely
important.  For example as we'll see in [Section 6]{#sec:interpretations}
probability distributions are naturally well-suited for many
applications.  Moreover the constraint of unit total measure endows
probability distributions with many exceptional theoretical properties
that help us better understand those applications in practice.

Because of these distinctions measure theory and probability theory are
often compartmentalized in the mathematics literature, with separate
textbooks, terminologies, and notations despite their common
mathematical foundations.

## Derived Properties

Although these definitions might appear to be a bit stark, we can derive
all of the usual rules of measure and probability theory from them.

For example consider one measurable subset that is strictly smaller
than another,
$$
\mathsf{x}_{1} \subset \mathsf{x}_{2} \in \mathcal{X}.
$$
In this case we can always write
$$
\mathsf{x}_{2} = \mathsf{x}_{1} \cup \mathsf{x}_{3}
$$
for the non-empty, measurable subset of elements that are in
$\mathsf{x}_{2}$ but not in $\mathsf{x}_{1}$.  Applying countable
additivity then gives
\begin{align*}
\pi(\mathsf{x}_{2})
&= \pi(\mathsf{x}_{1} \cup \mathsf{x}_{3})
\\
&= \pi(\mathsf{x}_{1}) + \pi(\mathsf{x}_{3})
\\
&\ge \pi(\mathsf{x}_{1})
\end{align*}
because $\pi(\mathsf{x}_{3}) \ge 0$.  In other words larger measurable
subsets are always allocated more or equal probability than smaller
subsets.

Similarly because any subset and its complement are disjoint and combine
to reconstruct the full set we always have
\begin{align*}
1
&= \pi(X)
\\
&= \pi(\mathsf{x} \cup \mathsf{x}^{c})
\\
&= \pi(\mathsf{x}) + \pi(\mathsf{x}^{c})
\end{align*}
or
$$
\pi(\mathsf{x}^{c}) = 1 - \pi(\mathsf{x}).
$$

In order to work with two measurable subsets
$\mathsf{x}_{1}, \mathsf{x}_{2} \in \mathcal{X}$ that might not be
disjoint (@fig-disjoint-decomposition) we have to consider the elements
that are unique to each,
$$
\mathsf{x}_{1 \setminus 2}
=
\{ x \in X \mid x \in \mathsf{x}_{1}, x \notin \mathsf{x}_{2} \}
$$
and
$$
\mathsf{x}_{2 \setminus 1}
=
\{ x \in X \mid x \in \mathsf{x}_{2}, x \notin \mathsf{x}_{1} \},
$$
and the elements that are shared,
$$
\mathsf{x}_{1} \cap \mathsf{x}_{2}
=
\{ x \in X \mid x \in \mathsf{x}_{1}, x \in \mathsf{x}_{2} \}.
$$

::: {#fig-disjoint-decomposition layout="[ [-20, 60, -20], [-5, 90, -5] ]"}
![](figures/overlapping_sets/inputs/inputs){#fig-input-subsets}

![](figures/overlapping_sets/disjoint_components/disjoint_components){#fig-disjoint-components}

The union of (a) two overlapping subsets $\mathsf{x}_{1}$ and
$\mathsf{x}_{2}$ can always be decomposed into the union of (b) three
disjoint subsets.  One disjoint subset $\mathsf{x}_{1 \setminus 2}$
encapsulates the elements unique to $\mathsf{x}_{1}$, another
$\mathsf{x}_{2 \setminus 1}$ encapsulates the elements unique to
$\mathsf{x}_{2}$, and finally the intersection
$\mathsf{x}_{1} \cap \mathsf{x}_{2}$ encapsulates the elements shared
by the two input subsets.
:::

This then allows us to decompose $\mathsf{x}_{1}$, $\mathsf{x}_{2}$,
and their union into disjoint, measurable subsets
(@fig-input-reconstruction,)
\begin{align*}
\mathsf{x}_{1} &=
\mathsf{x}_{1 \setminus 2} \cup (\mathsf{x}_{1} \cap \mathsf{x}_{2})
\\
\mathsf{x}_{2} &=
\mathsf{x}_{2 \setminus 1} \cup (\mathsf{x}_{1} \cap \mathsf{x}_{2})
\\
\mathsf{x}_{1} \cup \mathsf{x}_{2} &=
\mathsf{x}_{1 \setminus 2}
\cup
( \mathsf{x}_{1} \cap \mathsf{x}_{2} )
\cup
\mathsf{x}_{2 \setminus 1}.
\end{align*}

![The disjoint subsets introduced in (@fig-disjoint-decomposition) can
also be used to reconstruct the two input subsets individually.](
figures/overlapping_sets/input_reconstruction/input_reconstruction){
width=60% #fig-input-reconstruction}

Applying countable additivity to these three decompositions gives a
system of equations
\begin{align*}
\pi(\mathsf{x}_{1}) &=
\pi(\mathsf{x}_{1 \setminus 2}) + \pi(\mathsf{x}_{1} \cap \mathsf{x}_{2})
\\
\pi(\mathsf{x}_{2}) &=
\pi(\mathsf{x}_{2 \setminus 1}) + \pi(\mathsf{x}_{1} \cap \mathsf{x}_{2})
\\
\pi(\mathsf{x}_{1} \cup \mathsf{x}_{2}) &=
\pi(\mathsf{x}_{1 \setminus 2})
+ \pi(\mathsf{x}_{1} \cap \mathsf{x}_{2})
+ \pi \mathsf{x}_{2 \setminus 1}).
\end{align*}
Adding the first two together gives
$$
\pi(\mathsf{x}_{1}) + \pi(\mathsf{x}_{2})
=
\pi(\mathsf{x}_{1 \setminus 2})
+ 2 \, \pi(\mathsf{x}_{1} \cap \mathsf{x}_{2})
+ \pi(\mathsf{x}_{1} \cap \mathsf{x}_{2})
$$
or
$$
\pi(\mathsf{x}_{1 \setminus 2})
+ \pi(\mathsf{x}_{1} \cap \mathsf{x}_{2})
+ \pi(\mathsf{x}_{1} \cap \mathsf{x}_{2})
=
\pi(\mathsf{x}_{1}) + \pi(\mathsf{x}_{2})
- \pi(\mathsf{x}_{1} \cap \mathsf{x}_{2}).
$$
Substituting this into the third equation finally gives
$$
\pi(\mathsf{x}_{1} \cup \mathsf{x}_{2})
=
\pi(\mathsf{x}_{1}) + \pi(\mathsf{x}_{2})
- \pi(\mathsf{x}_{1} \cap \mathsf{x}_{2}).
$$

## Null Subsets { #sec:null }

The measure allocated to a measurable subset quantifies the weight of
that subset relative to any other measurable subsets.  Those measurable
subsets that are allocated _zero_ measure are the least important
subsets in terms of the overall allocation.  At the same time these
negligible subsets can be useful for characterizing certain properties
of a given measure.

Any measurable subset $\mathsf{x} \in \mathcal{X}$ that is allocated
zero measure
$$
\mu(\mathsf{x}) = 0
$$
is referred to as a **null subset** of the measure space
$(X, \mathcal{X}, \mu)$ or, more compactly, a $\mu$-null subset.
Similarly if
$$
\pi(\mathsf{x}) = 0
$$
then the measurable subset $\mathsf{x}$ is denoted a null subset of the
probability space $(X, \mathcal{X}, \pi)$, or simply a $\pi$-null
subset.

I will denote the collection of null subsets by
$$
\mathcal{X}_{\mu = 0}
= \{ \mathsf{x} \in \mathcal{X} \mid \mu(\mathsf{x}) = 0 \}
\subset \mathcal{X}.
$$

Most properties of measures depend on the detailed allocation of the
total across all measurable subsets.  Some useful properties, however,
are completely characterized by which measurable subsets receive a
non-zero allocation and which measurable subsets receive a zero
allocation.  In other words these null properties can be completely
derived from $\mathcal{X}_{\mu = 0}$.

Any two measures that share the same null subsets,
$$
\mathcal{X}_{\mu_{1} = 0} = \mathcal{X}_{\mu_{2} = 0}
$$
will share any properties that are derived from those null subsets.
Consequently the overlap in null subsets, or the lack thereof, is often
a useful way to determine how compatible two measures are with each
other.  We'll formalize this compatibility when we construct density
functions in
[Chapter Six](https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/chapters_html/density_functions.html).

Many formal calculations become particularly straightforward when every
subset of a null subset is a null subset as well.  This allows us to
decompose null subsets into smaller subsets without having to worry
about measurability concerns.  Any measure with recursively-consistent
null subsets is known as a **complete measure**.

Unfortunately many measures that we encounter in practice, for example
many measures defined with respect to Borel $\sigma$-algebras, are not
complete because not enough subsets are measurable.  In these cases
extending the initial $\sigma$-algebra to include every subset of the
initial null subsets is particularly useful for more technical work.
That said these considerations have little to no practical consequence.

## Measures and Probability Distributions In Practice

The formal definition of measures and probability distributions tell us
what form the consistent allocation of any quantity on any measurable
space has to take, but it does not necessarily provide a way for
constructing explicit allocations in practice.  Specifically in almost
all circumstances it is infeasible, if not outright impossible, to
exhaustively specify the measure or probability allocated to _every_
subset in the ambient $\sigma$-algebra.  Constructing and then storing
infinitely large databases linking each measurable subset, or even just
the non-null subsets, to their allocations is not particularly
practical!

In some cases we can define useful measures and probability
distributions by specifying the allocation to only _some_ of the
measurable subsets and then deriving the allocations to the rest with
countable additivity.  For example in finite and countable spaces we
need to specify only the allocations to all atomic subsets.  Similarly
measures over $(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{R}})$ can be completely
specified by allocations to all interval subsets.

That said in most of these cases those reduced allocations are still
impractical to specify one-by-one.  Because of that our introduction to
general measure and probability theory will have to remain a bit
abstract, without many explicit examples, for the time being.

In applied problems measures and probability distributions are almost
always defined _algorithmically_, with rules to evaluate the measure or
probability allocated to a subset on the fly instead of storing and
retrieving the allocation from an exhaustive specification.  We will
introduce two of these algorithmic representations, and use them to
define many useful allocations, in Chapter Five and Chapter Eight.

# Uniform Measures

Any given measurable space $(X, \mathcal{X})$ can be equipped with
infinitely many measures and probability distributions.  Some of these
objects, however, are more useful in applied practice than others.

This section will introduce two measures that encode distinct notions of
_uniformity_ that are applicable to different types of ambient spaces.
In the following chapters we will see how the properties of these
**uniform measures** make them particularly useful in practical
applications of probability theory.

## The Counting Measure On Discrete Measurable Spaces

Intuitively a uniform measure should allocate the same measure to as
many measurable subsets as possible.  The consistency of measures,
however, limits just how many subsets can receive the same allocation.
For example if two disjoint subsets $\mathsf{x}_{1} \in \mathcal{X}$
and $\mathsf{x}_{2} \in \mathcal{X}$ are allocated the same measure,
$$
\mu(\mathsf{x}_{1}) = \mu(\mathsf{x}_{2}) = \mu_{0},
$$
then their union will be allocated the measure,
$$
\mu(\mathsf{x}_{1}) \cup \mu(\mathsf{x}_{2})
=
\mu(\mathsf{x}_{1}) + \mu(\mathsf{x}_{2})
=
2 \, \mu_{0};
$$
all three allocations will be equal only if $\mu_{0} = \infty$.

In order to define a notion of uniformity that doesn't abuse infinity we
need to restrict our consideration from the entire $\sigma$-algebra to
collections of measurable subsets that we want to behave in the same
way.  If this collection is large enough then we can completely define a
uniform measure by enforcing the same allocation to those distinguished
subsets.

For example on any countable measure space $(X, 2^{X})$ a natural
collection of subsets to consider are the atomic subsets.  Because in
this case the measure allocated to these subsets completely specifies
the allocations to every other subset we can fully define a uniform
measure by a enforcing the same allocation to each element.  This
results in a constant mass function
(@fig-uniform-mass-function).

![On a countable space any uniform measure allocates the same measure to
every individual element resulting in a constant mass function.](
figures/uniform_mass_function/uniform_mass_function){
width=80% #fig-uniform-mass-function}

In particular the **counting measure** on the discrete measurable space
$(X, 2^{X})$ is defined by a unit allocation to each atomic set,
$$
\chi(\{ x \}) = 1.
$$
Equivalently we can define the counting measure with a uniform mass
function that assigns each element to a unit allocation,
$$
\chi(x) = 1.
$$

Given these element-wise allocations we can derive the measure allocated
to any other subset $\mathsf{x} \subset X$ by countable additivity,
\begin{align*}
\chi( \mathsf{x} )
&= \sum_{x \in \mathsf{x}} \chi(\{ x \})
\\
&= \sum_{x \in \mathsf{x}} 1,
\end{align*}
which always results in the total number of elements in $\mathsf{x}$.
The total counting measure,
$$
\chi( X ) = \sum_{x \in X} 1,
$$
just counts the number of elements in the ambient set.  In other words a
counting measure formalizes our intuitive notion of counting discrete
objects.

An immediate consequence of these derived allocations is that _any_
subset with the same number of elements will receive the same
allocation.  Uniformity over the individual elements induces uniformity
over other subsets as well.

When there are only a finite number of elements in $X$ the total measure
will also be finite.  In this case we can normalize the counting measure
into a uniform probability distribution,
$$
\pi ( \mathsf{x} ) =
\frac{ \sum_{x \in \mathsf{x}} 1 }{ \sum_{x \in X} 1 },
$$
which quantifies the proportion of all of the elements in $X$ that are
contained in $\mathsf{x}$.  If there are an infinite number of elements
in $X$ then this normalization is no longer possible; for example there
is no well-defined notion of a uniform probability distribution over the
integers $\mathbb{Z}$.

Counting measures are not the only uniform measures that we could define
over a countable ambient set.  More generally we can define a uniform
measure by allocating any positive real number $c \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$ to
each element,
$$
\kappa(\{ x \}) = c.
$$
That said these other uniform measures are somewhat redundant in the
sense that their allocations can be recovered by scaling the
corresponding counting measure allocations,
$$
\kappa ( \mathsf{x} ) = c \cdot \chi ( \mathsf{x} ).
$$

One important feature of a counting measure, indeed any uniform measure,
is that every subset except the empty set receives a non-zero
allocation.  That is to say that the empty set is the _only_
$\chi$-null subset.

## The Lebesgue Measure On Real Lines {#sec:lebesgue}

Unfortunately on uncountable spaces element-wise allocations do not
completely define measures.  In order to generalize any notion of
uniform measure we have to specify a larger class of measurable subsets
that should receive equal allocations.

An uncountable set alone, however, offers no criteria for preferring
any collection of subsets to any other, and hence no criteria for
defining a consistent notion of uniform measure.  Additional structure
on $X$, however, may be able to break this ambiguity.

Consider for example a real line $\mathbb{R}$ equipped with an
appropriate ordering, algebra, metric, and topology as discussed in
[Chapter Two](https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/chapters_html/spaces.html),
that is a particular rigid real line or a particular parameterization of
a flexible real line.  Using the ordering we can construct closed interval
subsets,
$$
[ x_{1}, x_{2} ] = \{ x \in \mathbb{R} \mid x_{1} \le x \le x_{2} \}.
$$
We can then use the metric to characterize these intervals by the
distance between the end points,
$$
L( \, [ x_{1}, x_{2} ] \, ) = d( x_{1}, x_{2} ) = | x_{2} - x_{1} |,
$$
otherwise known as the interval **length**.  Moreover if we use a Borel
$\sigma$-algebra derived from the real topology then these closed
intervals will all be measurable subsets.

Any notion of uniformity that is compatible with all of this structure
should treat all interval subsets with the _same length_ in the same way.
In other words a uniform measure over $\mathbb{R}$ should allocate the
same measure to all equal-length intervals (@fig-equal-length-intervals).
For example because the intervals
$$
L( \, [-2, -1] \, ) = L( \, [5, 6] \, ) = L( \, [150, 151] \,)
$$
all have the same length any uniform measure should give
$$
\mu( \, [-2, -1] \, ) = \mu( \, [5, 6] \, ) = \mu( \, [150, 151] \, ).
$$
Likewise because
$$
L( \, [-350, -300] \, ) = L( \, [0, 50] \, )
$$
we should have
$$
\mu( \, [-350, -300] \, ) = \mu( \, [0, 50] \,),
$$
and so on.

![The structure that defines a real line also distinguishes interval
subsets that we can characterize by their length.  Any uniform measure
over a real line should allocate the same measure to any interval with
the same length.](
figures/interval_partitions/interval_partitions){
width=90% #fig-equal-length-intervals}

The easiest way to accomplish this uniformity is to allocate to each
interval a measure directly equal to its length,
$$
\lambda( \, [x_{1}, x_{2}] \, )
= L( \, [x_{1}, x_{2}] \, )
= | x_{2} - x_{1} |.
$$
Allocations to more general measurable subsets can then be derived from
these interval allocations.  The resulting uniform measure over a given
real line is known as the **Lebesgue measure**.

Just as the counting measure formalizes intuition notions of counting
on countable spaces, the Lebesgue measure formalizes intuitive notions
of length on a real line.  This formalization of length, however, is a
bit more subtle.  Counting behaves the same on all countable spaces,
but length can behave differently across different real lines!

Two real lines with incompatible metrics -- different rigid real lines
or different parameterizations of a flexible real line -- will assign
different lengths to the same intervals, resulting in different Lebesgue
measures.  When there might be any chance of confusion we have to be
careful to communicate _which_ real line we're using in any given
application.

Because the total Lebesgue measure is infinitely large,
\begin{align*}
\lambda(\mathbb{R})
&=
\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \lambda( \, [-x, x] \, )
\\
&=
\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} 2 \, | x |
\\
&=
\infty,
\end{align*}
it cannot be normalized into a probability distribution.  As with the
integers there is no well-defined notion of a uniform probability
distribution over a real line.

Every other uniform measure over a real line is defined by allocating a
measure to each interval _proportional_ to its length,
$$
\nu( \, [a, b] \, ) \propto l( \, [a, b] \, ).
$$
Consequently every uniform measure over a real line reduces to a
constant scaling of the Lebesgue measure,
$$
\nu ( \mathsf{x} ) \propto \lambda ( \mathsf{x} ),
$$
similar to how every uniform measure over countable spaces reduces to a
scaling of the counting measure.

By definition the Lebesgue measure on any real line will allocate zero
measure to individual points,
\begin{align*}
\lambda(\{ x \})
&= \lambda([x, x])
\\
&= d(x, x)
\\
&= 0.
\end{align*}
Indeed any measurable subset with only a countable number of elements
will also be $\lambda$-null,
\begin{align*}
\lambda(\mathsf{x})
&=
\lambda(\cup_{i} \{ x_{i} \} )
\\
&=
\sum_{i} \lambda( \{ x_{i} \} )
\\
&=
\sum_{i} 0
\\
&=
0.
\end{align*}

Critically these properties follow from $d(x, x) = 0$ which is true for
_any_ well-behaved metric.  Two real lines with incompatible metrics
might feature different Lebesgue measures, but those Lebesgue measures
will always share the same null subsets and hence share any properties
derived from those null subsets.  Moving between rigid real lines or
parameterizations of a flexible real line will change the Lebesgue
measure but not these shared properties.

Let's conclude on a more technical note.  Allocations based on interval
lengths can be used to derive consistent allocations over any subset
constructed from open and closed subsets, and hence every measurable
subset in the Borel $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{R}}$.  They
can also be used, however, to derive null allocations to many subsets
that are _not_ in $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{R}}$.

Extending $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{R}}$ to include these additional null
subsets results in a larger $\sigma$-algebra known as the
**Lebesgue $\sigma$-algebra**.  Conveniently if we define the Lebesgue
measure with respect to this larger $\sigma$-algebra then it becomes a
complete measure which, as we have previously discussed, facilitates
many technical results and is consequently preferred in more formal
mathematical references.

Many references reserve the term "Lebsegue measure" for the _complete_
uniform measure defined over the Lebesgue $\sigma$-algebra and introduce
the term "Borel measure" for the _incomplete_ uniform measure defined
over the smaller Borel $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{R}}$.
That said because the differences between these definitions are limited
to null subsets they can be effectively ignored in most practical
applications.

## The Lebesgue Measure On Multivariate Real Spaces

The construction of the Lebesgue measure on a real line immediately
generalizes to multivariate real spaces built up from multiple real
lines at the same time.  Within each component real line we can allocate
a uniform Lebesgue measure to each interval subset,
$$
\lambda_{i}( \, [x_{1, i}, x_{2, i}] \, )
= | x_{2, i} - x_{1, i} |.
$$
To ensure uniformity over the composite product space we need to
allocate to each rectangular subset a measure equal to the product of
these component allocations,
\begin{align*}
\lambda( \, \times_{i = 1}^{I} [ x_{1, i}, x_{2, i} ] )
&=
\prod_{i = 1}^{I} \lambda_{i}( \, [x_{1, i}, x_{2, i}] \, )
\\
&=
\prod_{i = 1}^{I} | x_{2, i} - x_{1, i} |.
\end{align*}
As in the one-dimensional case allocations to more general measurable
subsets are derived from these rectangular allocations.

Intuitively the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}$ quantifies length.
The Lebesgue measure over $\mathbb{R}^{2}$, however, quantifies _area_.
More generally the Lebesgue measure over $\mathbb{R}^{I}$ quantifies
_volume_.

## Uniformity, Ignorance, and Information

The concepts of **ignorance** and **information** are related to
uniformity; formalizing the relationships between these concepts,
however, is subtle.  In order to avoid confusing these concepts we have
take care to recognize not only their similarities but also their
differences.

When two elements of a countable space are allocated the same measure
then the overall allocation will be the same even if we permute those
two elements before allocating measures.  In other words any measure
that allocates the same measure to two elements is not able to
distinguish between any permutations of those elements.

The more regular the individual allocations are the less sensitive the
resulting measure will be to any rearrangement of the elements.
Conversely the more the allocations vary from element to element the
more the resulting measure will able to discern one permutation from
another.  Informally we might say that the more uniform the measure the
less information it encodes.  Because a uniform measure allocates the
same measure to every element it is ignorant to _any_ bijective
transformation of the elements, capturing the least information possible
on a countable space.

On uncountable spaces these concepts become more delicate.  The
allocations defined by the Lebesgue measure, for example, are _not_
invariant to arbitrary transformations of the real line.  Any
transformation that warps the metric will also warp lengths and hence
the measures allocated by the Lebesgue measure.  Instead the Lebesgue
measure is ignorant only to transformations that preserve distances.

In order to formalize heuristic concepts like "ignorance" and
"information" we have to embrace a bit more abstraction.  Recall that in
[Chapter Two](https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/chapters_html/spaces.html)
we discussed the notion of a structure-preserving transformation.  More
generally if $\phi : X \rightarrow X$ is a structure-preserving
automorphism then we say that the structure is **symmetric** to $\phi$
while the transformation $\phi$ is a **symmetry** of the structure.

In other words if $\phi$ is a symmetry of a structure $\mathfrak{x}$
then the behavior of $\mathfrak{x}$ is the same before and after we
apply the transformation.  The structure cannot detect whether or not we
apply the transformation.  For example on a real line the metric is
symmetric to translations,
\begin{align*}
d( t_{x_{3}}(x_{1}), t_{x_{3}}(x_{2}) )
&=
| t_{x_{3}}(x_{2}) - t_{x_{3}}(x_{1}) |
\\
&=
| x_{2} + x_{3} - (x_{1} + x_{3}) |
\\
&=
| x_{2} - x_{1} |
\\
&=
d(x_{1}, x_{2}).
\end{align*}

Some structures admit multiple symmetries at the same time.  For example
the discrete topology on a countable set is invariant to any permutation
of the elements while the metric on a real line is invariant to all
translations of the elements.  The more symmetric a structure is the
less it can distinguish between arbitrary transformations to the ambient
set. If we formalize information as the ability of a structure to
distinguish between transformations of the ambient set then the more
symmetric a structure is the less information it encodes.

From an abstract perspective measures and probability distributions are,
like orderings, algebras, metrics, topologies, and $\sigma$-algebras,
just structures that we can endow onto a set.  The more invariant a
measure is to transformations of that set the less information it will
contain.  We will more formally consider how measures transform,
and hence how to precisely define symmetries of a measure, in
[Chaper Seven](https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/chapters_html/transforming_probability_spaces.html).

Uniform measures are built to be symmetric to at least some
transformations and hence encode less information than other measures.
For example the counting measure is invariant to any permutation of a
countable ambient set while the Lebesgue measure is invariant to any
translation of a real line.  We can also extend this construction to
more elaborate spaces, for instance defining uniform measures on spheres
that are invariant to any rotation.

Critically, however, not every uniform measure is invariant to every
possible transformation of the ambient set; some uniform measures are
more informative than others!  Consequently notions of uniformity do not
define any _universal_ notions of ignorance, just ignorance to the
particular transformations that are used to define uniformity in a given
context.

In practice this means that we have to be careful not to make broad
claims about uniform measures that are least informative or most
ignorant but instead specify _with respect to which transformations_ a
measure might be least informative or most ignorant.

# Interpretations of Measure And Probability { #sec:interpretations }

To this point our treatment of measure and probability theory has been
purely mathematical.  A measures defines the allocations of some
abstract conserved quantity across some abstract measurable space;
a probability distribution defines a proportional allocations.  This
mathematical construction cannot be endowed with any particular
interpretation until we use it to model something.

In this section we'll review some of the most common applications of
measure and probability theory and the particular interpretations those
applications create.

## Modeling Physical Distributions

One immediate application of measure theory is to model the behavior of
a physical quantity, such as mass or electric charge.  For example
physical mass can be distributed across a solid object in a variety of
different ways, with the exact distribution affecting how that object
interacts with the surrounding environment.  Similarly the distribution
of charge across the surface of a conducting object defines its
electrostatic properties.

In some physical systems the distribution can also change with time
and influence the dynamics of the system.  Time-dependent measures that
quantify how the distribution of a physical quantity evolves are a
common feature of many mathematical physical theories.

## Modeling Populations

A similar application is modeling the selection of individuals, or
the properties of individuals, from a larger population.  Each time we
_sample_ a subset of individuals from the population we will observe a
different ensemble of behaviors, such as political or consumer
preferences, heights, or ages.  The heterogeneity of these
characteristics across the population can often be quantified with
measures, and their relative occurrences modeled with probability
distributions.

For example is $30\%$ of the individuals in a population have a height
between $0$ feet and $5$ feet then a probability distribution modeling
the variation in heights would give
$$
\pi([0, 5]) = 0.3.
$$

## Modeling Frequencies

An application particular to probability theory concerns the frequencies
of repeated events.

Consider an abstract event whose outcomes take _unpredictable_ values in
some space $X$.  Perfectly replicating the circumstances of this event
$N$ times defines a sequence of values in $Y$,
$$
\{ x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}, \ldots x_{N} \}.
$$

While we cannot predict what values the individual events in this
sequence will take, we may be able to characterize how often certain
outcomes appear relative to others.  In particular we can define the
**frequency** of a subset $\mathsf{x} \subset X$ by the number of events
that that take values in $\mathsf{x}$,
$$
f_{N}(\mathsf{x})
= \frac{ \sum_{n = 1}^{N} \mathbb{I}_{\mathsf{x}}(x_{n}) }{N},
$$
where
$$
\mathbb{I}_{\mathsf{x}}(x)
=
\left\{
\begin{array}{rr}
1, & x \in \mathsf{x} \\
0, & x \notin \mathsf{x}
\end{array}
\right. .
$$

Replicating the event a countably infinite number of times defines the
**asymptotic** or **long-run** frequency of a subset,
\begin{align*}
f(\mathsf{x})
&=
\lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} f_{N}(\mathsf{x})
\\
&=
\lim_{N \rightarrow \infty}
\frac{ \sum_{n = 1}^{N} \mathbb{I}_{\mathsf{x}}(x_{n}) }{N}.
\end{align*}
In other words the more frequent subsets contain more common event
outcomes.

If the frequencies are the same for _any_ sequence of events then we can
model them with probability theory.  Specifically we can interpret the
allocated probabilities as the proportion of the total event outcomes
that fall into each subset of outcome values.

In this case the particular ordering of the event sequences doesn't
matter and we can also interpret them as defining a population of
possible events.  From this perspective the application of probability
theory is equivalent to the application in the previous section.  At
the same time if we interpret repeated samples from a population as
events then the population probabilities can be interpreted as
frequencies.

## Modeling Uncertainties

Probability theory can also be used to consistently quantify uncertain
information.

Consider a space of possible statements $X$.  Under perfect knowledge we
would be able to specify a particular statement $x \in X$ as true with
all other statements in $X$ being false.  In other words certainty is
quantified with binary true/false assignments.  When our knowledge is
not quite so certain, however, we have to soften those claims.

To quantify uncertain information we have to generalize beyond binary
true/false assignments to continuous values that _interpolate_ between
absolute truth and falsity.  The larger the value we assign to a subset
of statements the more our uncertain information supports one of those
statements being true.  Conversely the smaller the value we assign to a
subset the more our uncertain information supports all of the included
statements being false.

Applying probability theory allows us to enforce consistent uncertainty
assignments across all of the possible statements.  The individual
probability allocations can then be interpreted as quantifying how
strongly our information supports that one of the statements within a
measurable set is true.  In this setting the allocated probabilities are
sometimes referred to as "plausibilities", "credibilities", and
"beliefs".

For example the property that $\pi(X) = 1$ corresponds to the fact that
at least one of the statements in $X$ always has to be true.  A
probability distribution that concentrates around the statement $x$
encodes confidence that one of the statements near $x$ is true.  The
singular limit where all of the available probability collapses onto a
single statement, $\pi( \{ x \} ) = 1$, communicates certainty that $x$
is true.

This kind of probabilistic uncertainty quantification can be interpreted
in many ways.  For example we can use it out model the personal,
subjective beliefs that an individual holds about the behavior of a
system.  In particular we can use it to model our own specific beliefs.
At the same time we can use it to model the collective understanding of
entire communities.  We can also use probability theory to model only
certain aspects of individual or community knowledge and not attempt to
quantify the entirety of that knowledge at once.

More formally this application defines one way to generalize classical
propositional logic to a many-valued logic.  Using probability theory to
generalize other logical systems can sometimes also be possible,
although the technical details quickly become more complicated.

## Everyone Play Nicely

A key point of confusion in probability theory is the confounding of its
abstract mathematical structure with the interpretations that arise in
particular applications.  This confusion is made all the worse by the
long history of attempts to _derive_ probability theory from these
particular applications.

For example many have tried to derive probabilities as asymptotic
frequencies of physical events.  The key motivations of this approach is
that the resulting probabilities would be objective in the sense that
everyone who could implement those infinite trials would attain the same
probabilities.  Even if we ignore the impracticality of perfectly
repeating an event an infinite number of times within a finite lifetime
it turns out that there are also some subtle mathematical complications
with this approach.  For a comprehensive discussion see
@DiaconisEtAl:2017.

Similarly many have tried to derive probability theory from uncertainty
quantification.  For example the Cox postulates (@VanHorn:2003) define
basic intuitions about uncertainty quantification.  On simpler spaces
these rules are equivalent to probability theory, but that equivalence
doesn't persist to more general spaces.  Because of that this approach
is not able to recover the full generality of probability theory.

A common reaction to these technical difficulties is to resort to a sort
of philosophical bait and switch.  When one cannot derive probability
theory from a particular application one might define probability theory
abstractly, as we have done above, but then impose an _arbitrary_
restriction that it can only ever be applied to that one application.
For example those trying to derive probability theory from frequencies
might argue that probability theory can be applied to model only
frequencies, in which case all probabilities are frequencies.  Others
trying to derive probability theory from the Cox axioms might argue that
any application of probability theory always models uncertain
information.

These interpretational restrictions then force some awkward
philosophical contortions when trying to apply probability theory in
practice.  For example after imposing that all probabilities are
frequencies the only way to model uncertainty in the value of some
quantity is to treat it as the outcome of some hypothetical, and
completely non-existent, event.  The introduction of these hypothetical
events to real events makes the entire system more difficult to
understand.

In this book we will avoid these restrictions, respect the full
generality of probability theory, and take advantage of any consistent
applications that might be useful in a given problem.  Indeed we will
often take advantage of multiple applications _at the same time_.

Consider, for example, a binary space $X = {0, 1}$ that corresponds to
the two sides of a coin. In particular let `0` denote tails and `1`
denote heads.  Any probability distribution over $X$ can be quantified
with the probability $p \in [0, 1]$ allocated to the point `1`, which
gives the consistent probability allocations
\begin{align*}
\pi( \emptyset; p ) &= 0
\\
\pi( {0}; p ) &= 1 - p
\\
\pi( {1}; p ) &= p
\\
\pi( X; p ) &= 1.
\end{align*}

There are many ways to flip a coin, but let's say that we flip our coin
in a way that results in an unpredictable sequence of heads and tails.
The asymptotic frequencies of these outcomes can then be modeled with an
application of probability theory.  In other words we can use a
probability distribution $\pi(\cdot; p)$ to model the physical outcomes
of the flips.

At the same time we use probability theory to model any uncertainty in
which of the possible frequency models best matches the true behavior of
the coin.  In particular we can construct a probability distribution
over the unit interval to quantify how compatible each probability
allocation $p \in [0, 1]$ is with our knowledge of the coin.

If we have a bag of $I$ coins then could also model the variation
in the probability parameters
$$
\{ p_{1}, \ldots, p_{i}, \ldots, p_{I} \}
$$
for each coin.  In this case we can apply probability theory once again,
this time to model the population of coin behaviors.

To be clear the interpretations inherent to particular applications of
probability theory are important for ensuring that we implement those
applications correctly in practice.  Elevating one interpretation to
the exclusion of others, however, excludes the corresponding
applications and limits the full potential of probability theory.  To
take full advantage of the practical utility of probability theory we
have to respect all of consistent applications!

# Conclusion

Conceptually measure and probability theory are straightforward.
Measure theory quantifies how we can consistently allocate a conserved
quantify across a general mathematical space and probability theory
considers the special case of proportional allocations.  In order to
quantify that conceptual simplicity, however, we need to resort to some
careful mathematics.  In particular we need to incorporate
$\sigma$-algebras to surgically remove any pathological behavior that
can arise, even on seemingly well-behaved spaces such as the real line,
and obstruct consistent allocations.

Once we've safely constructed these theories in full generality we can
use the apply abstract mathematics to model particular systems.  Within
these applications the math inherits particular interpretations, but we
have to be careful to not take these circumstantial interpretations too
seriously lest we abandon the full utility of the abstract mathematics.

The technical exploration of measures and probability distributions
goes far beyond the introduction in this chapter.  Unfortunately many
textbooks that cover this material can be difficult to parse without
extensive mathematical experience.  My personal favorite is
@Folland:1999 which, while technically rigorous, provides more
exposition and motivation than I have found in other treatments.
