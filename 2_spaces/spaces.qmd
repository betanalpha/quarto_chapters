In
[Chapter One](https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/chapters_html/probability_on_finite_sets.html)
I introduced probability theory on finite sets; this simple setting allowed us
to focus on the basic concepts without too much mathematical distraction.
Unfortunately finite sets have only limited use in practical applications.
Instead these applications typically require probability theory on not only more
sophisticated sets but also sets that are equipped with additional structure.
These combinations of sets and structure are also known as _spaces_.

In this chapter we will discuss the basic conceptual features of general spaces
before reviewing some of prototypical spaces that are particularly common in
practical applications.  This presentation will include not only the properties
of sets with an arbitrary number of elements but also a survey of some of the
most fundamental structures that we can endow onto those sets.

# Spaces

In both more applied and more pure mathematics the term "space" is omnipresent
but subject to ambiguous and sometimes inconsistent interpretation.  Some, for
example, use the term to refer to any set of interest while some reserve it for
sets endowed with additional mathematical _structure_.  Still others use the
term to denote sets endowed with not just any structure but particular, and
often only implied, structure.  Consequently we have to be careful when seeing
the term to make sure we understand the exact intent of the author.

Throughout this book I will use the term **space** to describe _any_ set
equipped with _any_ structure.  When the particular structure is relevant I will
be careful to specify exactly what structure has been endowed to the set.  In
this section we will review the properties shared by all sets and then some of
the most common structures that we can introduce to enhance a set with
additional complexity.

## Sets

A finite set is a collection of a finite number of abstract **elements**.  More
generally a **set** is a collection of an _arbitrary_ number of elements.  The
elements that compromise a set are also referred to as **points**, although this
is often used only when the set is part of a space.

In general a set can contain not only a finite number of elements but also an
_infinite_ number of elements.  An infinite set whose elements can be indexed by
integers is referred as a **countably infinite set**.  Finite and countably
infinite sets are together denoted **countable sets**.  When a set contains so
many elements that they cannot be indexed by the integers then we refer to it as
an **uncountably infinite set** or simply an **uncountable set**.  If we want to
imply additional structure then we might also say **countable space** and
**uncountable space**.

To work with a set in practice we will need to be able to reference the elements
it contains and organize those elements into subsets.

### Variables

Working with sets that contain more than a few elements is easier when we can
refer to an abstract element without explicitly enumerating _all_ of the
elements.  A **variable element**, or simply **variable**, is a symbol that can
represent _any_ element in a given set.  In this book I maintain a convention
where capital letters refer to sets and the corresponding lower case letters
refer to variables.  For example $x$ denotes a variable taking values in the
set $X$ or, more compactly, $x \in X$.

To represent multiple, possibly distinct elements of a set we need to employ
multiple variables.  For example we might use ticks so that $x, x', x'' \in X$
all denote distinct variables that can correspond to common or different
elements in $X$.  We can also use integer indices to distinguish between these
variables when helpful; in this case $x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3} \in X$ would denote
three distinct variables that can correspond to common or different values in
$X$.  At the same time non-numerical labels such as $x_{a}, x_{b}, x_{c} \in X$
or even $x_{\text{input}}, x_{\text{output}} \in X$ can be more useful in some
circumstances.

When two variables $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ represent the _same_ element we say that
they are _equal_.  We can specify equality by writing $x_{1} = x_{2}$.

In many circumstances we will need to distinguish between variables that refer
to _arbitrary_ elements and variables that refer to _particular_ but unspecified
elements.  Following the computer science canon I will refer to these as
**unbound variables** and **bound variables**, respectively.  To distinguish
between the two I will decorate bound variables with a tilde; in words $x$
denotes any element of the space $X$ while $\tilde{x}$ denotes a fixed but
unspecified element.

### Subsets

As with finite spaces any selection of elements from a general set defines a
**subset**.  Subsets equipped with similar structure as the full set are also
referred to as **subspaces**.

Selecting elements from a subset $\mathsf{x} \subset X$ defines another subset
$\mathsf{x}' \subset X$.  If $\mathsf{x}$ contains all of the elements of
$\mathsf{x}'$ and more then we write $\mathsf{x}' \subset \mathsf{x}$; if it
might contain only the elements in $\mathsf{x}'$ then we write
$\mathsf{x}' \subseteq \mathsf{x}$.  In the latter case we can also say that
$\mathsf{x}'$ is _smaller_ than $\mathsf{x}$.

Following the treatment of finite spaces in the previous chapter I will refer to
the collection of all subsets that can be selected from a set $X$ as the
corresponding **power set** and denote it $2^X$.  In general the power set
$2^X$ will contain more elements than the originating set $X$; the power sets
derived from uncountable sets are so massive that they are typically
contaminated with all kinds of _misbehaving_ subsets.  We'll see one consequence
of this contamination in the next chapter.

When a set contains only a small number of elements we can readily define each
subset by _explicitly_ specifying the elements it contains.  For larger sets
this quickly becomes impractical, if not outright impossible.  In these cases
subsets are more easily defined _implicitly_ as the elements satisfying a
certain condition.  These implicit definitions are neatly encapsulated in the
**set-builder notation**,
$$
\mathsf{x} = \{ x \in X \mid \text{ condition(x) } \}
$$
which we can read as "the elements of $X$ such that the element-wise condition
is satisfied".

For example if the function $f : X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ assigns to each
element $x$ a value $f(x)$ then we could define a subset as the collection of
elements that are assigned the particular value $0$.  In set-builder notation
this would become
$$
\mathsf{x} = \{ x \in X \mid f(x) = 0 \}.
$$

The power set derived from any set always contains the **empty set** consisting
of no elements, **atomic sets** or **singleton sets** each consisting of a
single element, and a **full set** consisting of the entire set (@fig-subsets).
Most subsets, however, contain an intermediate number of elements.  One of the
key features of uncountable spaces is that most subsets also contain an
uncountable number of elements, but still only an infinitesimal proportion of
the total set.  To visually represent subsets containing an uncountable number
of elements I will used filled shapes to contrast against individual points.

::: {#fig-subsets layout="[ [-5, 45, 45, -5], [-5, 45, 45, -5]]"}
![](figures/sets/examples/empty/empty){#fig-empty}

![](figures/sets/examples/atomic/atomic){#fig-atomic}

![](figures/sets/examples/general/general){#fig-general}

![](figures/sets/examples/full/full){#fig-full}

On a general set we can construct (a) an empty set containing no elements, (b)
atomic sets containing only a single element, and even (d) a full set
containing all elements in the set.  (c) Most subsets are more intermediate,
containing multiple elements but not all of them.  Here filled shapes represent
a potentially uncountable number of individual elements.
:::

All of the set operations we introduced for finite sets generalize to any set.
For example for any set $X$ with power set $2^{X}$ we can define a unary
operation that maps each subset into a **complementary** subset consisting of
every other element (@fig-unary),
\begin{alignat*}{6}
\cdot^c :\; & 2^X & &\rightarrow& \; & 2^X &
\\
& \mathsf{x} & &\mapsto& & \mathsf{x}^{c} &.
\end{alignat*}

::: {#fig-unary layout="[ [-5, 45, 45, -5] ]"}
![](figures/sets/unary_set_operations/input/input){#fig-unary-input}

![](figures/sets/unary_set_operations/complement/complement){#fig-complement}

Every (a) subset defines a (b) complement subset consisting of all elements in
the set that are not contained in that initial subset.
:::

For any set the complement of the empty set is the full set and vice versa,
\begin{align*}
\emptyset^{c} &= X
\\
X^{c} &= \emptyset.
\end{align*}

The binary union and and intersection operations also generalize to general sets
(@fig-binary).  A **union** of two input subsets is the subset containing all of
the elements contained in _either_ input subset,
\begin{alignat*}{6}
\cdot \cup \cdot :\; & 2^{X} \times 2^{X}& &\rightarrow& \; & 2^{X} &
\\
& \mathsf{x}_1, \mathsf{x}_{2} & &\mapsto& & \mathsf{x}_1 \cup \mathsf{x}_2 &,
\end{alignat*}
and the **intersection** is the subset containing all of the elements in _both_
input subsets,
\begin{alignat*}{6}
\cdot \cap \cdot :\; & 2^{X} \times 2^{X}& &\rightarrow& \; & 2^{X} &
\\
& \mathsf{x}_1, \mathsf{x}_{2} & &\mapsto& & \mathsf{x}_1 \cap \mathsf{x}_2 &,
\end{alignat*}
**Venn diagrams** visualize unions and intersections as overlapping shapes.

::: {#fig-binary layout="[ [-5, 90, -5], [-5, 45, 45, -5]]"}
![](figures/sets/binary_set_operations/inputs/inputs){#fig-binary-inputs}

![](figures/sets/binary_set_operations/union/union){#fig-binary-union}

![](figures/sets/binary_set_operations/intersection/intersection){#fig-binary-intersection}

The union and intersection operations transform two input subsets into a single
output subset.  (a) A union consists of all elements in either input subset
while (b) an intersection consists of all elements in both input subsets.
:::

Two subsets are said to be **disjoint** when they don't overlap and hence don't
share any elements.  More formally two subsets are disjoint when their
intersection is the empty set,
$$
\mathsf{x}_{1} \cap \mathsf{x}_{2} = \emptyset.
$$

All of the properties of these binary operatations that we discussed for finite
sets also generalize to arbitrary sets.  For example the union and intersection
of a subset with itself always returns that subset,
$$
\mathsf{x} \cup \mathsf{x} = \mathsf{x} \cap \mathsf{x} = \mathsf{x}.
$$
Similarly the union of the empty set with any subset returns back that subset,
$$
\mathsf{x} \cup \emptyset = \emptyset \cup \mathsf{x} = \mathsf{x},
$$
and intersection of the empty set with any subset returns back the empty set,
$$
\mathsf{x} \cap \emptyset = \emptyset \cap \mathsf{x} = \emptyset.
$$
The union of any subset with the full set returns the full set,
$$
\mathsf{x} \cup X = X \cup \mathsf{x} = X,
$$
and the intersection of any subset with the full set returns back the subset,
$$
\mathsf{x} \cap X = X \cap \mathsf{x} = \mathsf{x}.
$$

The union and intersection operations also interact nicely with the complement
operation.  For example by construction the union of a subset and its complement
is the full set,
$$
\mathsf{x} \cup \mathsf{x}^{c} = X.
$$
On the other hand the two subsets share no elements so their intersection is
empty,
$$
\mathsf{x} \cap \mathsf{x}^{c} = \emptyset.
$$
Consequently a subset and its complement are always disjoint.

## Structures { #sec:structures }

A collection of elements alone is only so interesting mathematically and only so
useful in practice.  The sets of theoretical and practical interest are equipped
with additional **structures** that endow them with more rigidity and
interpretability.

Earlier I defined a space as any a set equipped with any structure.  When that
structure is explicit we often denote the space by specifying the underlying set
and the additional structure together.  For example if we denote the set $X$ and
the structure $\mathfrak{s}$ then we would denote the space $(X, \mathfrak{s})$.
Unfortunately these additional structures are often implicit and taken for
granted.  In this case $X$ is, frustratingly, typically used to denote both the
underlying set _and_ the resulting space.

In this section we will review just a few of the structures that play important
roles in practical applications.  Specifically we will focus on the structures
that define the most common spaces that arise in mathematical modeling.  We
will introduce probabilistic structures until the next chapter.

### Orderings

One way to enhance a set is to distinguish a special organization of its
elements.

An **strict ordering** or **complete ordering** establishes a particular
sequential arrangement of the elements in a set.  Mathematically we can encode
an ordering as local relations between elements, writing $x_{1} < x_{2}$ if the
element $x_{1}$ appears earlier in the ordering than $x_{2}$.  We also say that
$x_{1}$ is _smaller_ than $x_{2}$, and $x_{2}$ is _larger_ than $x_{1}$, if
$x_{1} < x_{2}$.  The ordering relation can also be interpreted as a binary
operation that takes two elements as inputs and returns true if the first input
element appears earlier in the ordering than the second input element and false
otherwise.

A consistent ordering of the elements in a set strongly constrains the behavior
of these relations.  For example if $x_{1} < x_{2}$ and $x_{2} < x_{3}$ then we
must have $x_{1} < x_{3}$.  This property is formally known as **transitivity**
of the individual relations.

A **partial ordering** defines a less rigid arrangement of a set that doesn't
allows multiple elements to be indistinguishable; in other words multiple
elements can occupy the same position along the sequential arrangement at the
same time.  To represent a partial ordering we use the relation $\le$ and write
$x_{1} \le x_{2}$ if the element appears earlier in the order
_or at the same place in the order as_ $x_{2}$.  This partial ordering relation
is not only transitive -- if $x_{1} \le x_{2}$ and $x_{2} \le x_{3}$ then
$x_{1} \le x_{3}$ -- but also allows us to compare any element to itself --
$x_{1} \le x_{1}$.  This latter property is formally known as **reflexivity**.

Intuitively we can interpret a strict ordering as a geometric arrangement of the
elements along a one-dimensional line.  Partial orderings are more general and
can often be interpreted as a geometrical arrangement of the elements along a
higher-dimensional plane.  Critically neither geometric interpretation relies
on any notion of distance between the elements; any arrangement still leaves the
individual elements quite fluid.

A set equipped with a particular ordering is referred to as an _ordered space_.
Likewise a set equipped with a particular partial ordering is referred to as
a _partially-ordered space_.

### Algebras

The term **algebra** is introduced so early in our mathematical education that
it can be especially easy to take for granted.  Typically it refers to equipping
a set with one or more _binary operations_ that manipulate any two input
elements into a single output element.  Some algebraic structures also introduce
_unary operations_ that transform a single input element into a single output
element.

Just about every possible algebraic structure has been studied and categorized
by mathematicians.  Unfortunately the resulting spaces are, with one exception,
not referred to as "algebraic spaces".  In most cases they are not even referred
to as "spaces"!  Instead each algebraic structure is given a special name, such
as "magma" and "group" and "field", that is not obviously related to the others.

Because of this barrage of terminology it can be difficult to compare and
contrast various algebraic structures.  Fortunately understanding them all is
absolutely not necessary for this book.  For those readers who are interested in
digger a little bit deeper into the technical vocabulary Wikipedia provides two
nice reviews
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_structure#Common_algebraic_structures)
and
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_algebraic_structures#Types_of_algebraic_structures).

In this section we will consider only a few particularly common algebraic
structures.

#### Single Algebraic Operation

A common convention when working with a single, binary algebraic operation is to
denote that operation as
\begin{alignat*}{6}
\cdot :\; & X \times X& &\rightarrow& \; & X &
\\
& x_{1}, x_{2} & &\mapsto& & x_{1} \cdot x_{2} &,
\end{alignat*}
where $x_{1}$ denotes the first input element and $x_{2}$ denotes the second
input element and $x_{1} \cdot x_{2}$ denotes the output element.  When working
with multiple algebraic operations at the same time we will have to use multiple
symbols to denote each operation.

Binary algebraic operations are characterized by a few key properties.  For
example a binary operation that is symmetric with respect to the input elements,
$$
x_{1} \cdot x_{2} = x_{2} \cdot x_{1},
$$
is referred to as a **commutative** operation.

A binary operation can be applied to more than two input elements by chaining
multiple evaluations.  For example we can apply a binary operation to the three
elements $x_{1}$, $x_{2}$, and $x_{3}$ by first taking $x_{1}$ as $x_{2}$ inputs
and then taking the resulting output as an input along with $x_{3}$,
$$
(x_{1} \cdot x_{2}) \cdot x_{3}.
$$
Alternatively we can first take $x_{2}$ and $x_{3}$ as inputs and then take
$x_{1}$ and the resulting output as inputs,
$$
x_{1} \cdot (x_{2} \cdot x_{3}).
$$
In general these two groupings will yield _different_ outputs.  Operations that
always give the same output for both groupings are referred to as
**associative** operations.

Some binary operations also distinguish special elements.  For example inputting
a particular element might reduce the operation to carrying forward the other
input element to the output no matter what it might be.  More formally a binary
operation might admit an element $x_{\text{Id}}$ such that
$$
x \cdot x_{\text{Id}} = x_{\text{Id}} \cdot x = x.
$$
for all $x \in X$.  In this case $x_{\text{Id}}$ is denoted a **unit element**
or **identity element** and the binary operation itself is referred to as a
**unital** operation.

Similarly an operation might allow a particular element to determine the output
no matter what the other input element is.  Formally there might exist an
element $x_{\text{Null}}$ such that
$$
x \cdot x_{\text{Null}} = x_{\text{Null}} \cdot x = x_{\text{Null}}
$$
for all $x \in X$.  If so then $x_{\text{Null}}$ can be denoted an
**absorbing element**, **null element**, or **zero element** with the binary
operation sometimes referred to as a **null** operation.

The existence of an identity element can also induce a special pairing between
the other elements in the set.  In particular some elements $x \in X$ might be
paired with another element $x^{-1} \in X$ such that the binary operation
returns the identity element,
$$
x \cdot x^{-1} = x^{-1} \cdot x = x_{\text{Id}}.
$$
If so then we say that $x^{-1}$ is the **inverse element** of $x$.  By
construction $x$ is also the inverse element of $x^{-1}$.  By construction the
identity element is always its own inverse element.  Conversely, because null
elements cannot result in an identity element output, they will never have
inverse elements.

Perhaps the most prominent binary algebraic operation is **addition** over the
integers and real numbers.  Addition is commutative, associative, and unital
with the identity element $x_{\text{Id}} = 0$.  Every element $x$ also features
a unique additive inverse element known as its **negation** and written as $-x$.
A corresponding **subtraction** operation can be defined as addition by additive
inverses,
$$
x_{1} - x_{2} \equiv x_{1} + (x_{2})^{-1} = x_{1} + (-x_{2}).
$$

A natural complement to addition is **multiplication**.  Multiplication is
commutative, associative, and unital with the identity element
$x_{\text{Id}} = 1$.  It is also null with the absorbing element
$x_{\text{Null}} = 0$.

When working with the integers no element admits a multiplicative inverse except
for the identity element.  On the other hand every real number $x$ except for
$x_{\text{Null}} = 0$ features a multiplicative inverse element known as its
**reciprocal** and written as $1 /x$.  We can define a **division** operation as
multiplication by multiplicative inverses,
$$
x_{1} / x_{2} \equiv x_{1} \cdot (x_{2})^{-1} = x_{1} \cdot \frac{1}{x_{2}}.
$$
Because $x_{\text{Null}} = 0$ doesn't have a multiplicative inverse, however, we
cannot divide by zero.

#### Multiple Algebraic Operations

If one algebraic operation is good then two should be better, right?  Multiple
algebraic operations that are _compatible_ with each other define particularly
rich algebraic structures.

In the context of two binary algebraic operation a common convention is to write
the first operator as
\begin{alignat*}{6}
+ :\; & X \times X& &\rightarrow& \; & X &
\\
& x_{1}, x_{2} & &\mapsto& & x_{1} + x_{2} &
\end{alignat*}
and the second as
\begin{alignat*}{6}
\cdot :\; & X \times X& &\rightarrow& \; & X &
\\
& x_{1}, x_{2} & &\mapsto& & x_{1} \cdot x_{2} &
\end{alignat*}
in analogy with addition and multiplication.  This notation might be used even
if the operators do not actually correspond to the usual addition and
multiplication operations.

The binary operation $\cdot$ is said to **distribute** across the binary
operation $+$ if
$$
x_3 \cdot (x_1 + x_2) = (x_3 \cdot x_1) + (x_3 \cdot x_2).
$$
Note that this property is asymmetric -- it does _not_ imply that $+$
distributes across $\cdot$,
$$
x_3 + (x_1 \cdot x_2) \ne (x_3 + x_1) \cdot (x_3 + x_2).
$$
A common example of compatible algebraic operations is addition and
multiplication over the integer and real numbers where multiplication
distributes across addition.  An algebraic structure compromised of these two
compatible operations is also known as **arithmetic**.

One of the most infamous algebraic structures considers a slightly different
combination of operations.  Instead of a binary operator that takes two elements
as inputs we can define a binary operator that takes as inputs one element and
one real number,
\begin{alignat*}{6}
\cdot :\; & \mathbb{R} \times X& &\rightarrow& \; & X &
\\
& \alpha, x & &\mapsto& & \alpha \cdot x &.
\end{alignat*}
This is sometimes referred to as a **scalar multiplication** operator.

A **linear algebra** combines this operation with an associative, commutative,
and unital binary operator
\begin{alignat*}{6}
+ :\; & X \times X& &\rightarrow& \; & X &
\\
& x_{1}, x_{2} & &\mapsto& & x_{1} + x_{2} &
\end{alignat*}
such that $\cdot$ distributes over $+$,
$$
\alpha \cdot (x_{1} + x_{2}) = \alpha \cdot x_{1} + \alpha \cdot x_{2}.
$$
A set equipped with these operators is also known as a **vector space** with
the individual elements denoted **vectors**.

### Metrics

Another way to add structure to a set is to introduce an explicit notion of
**distance** between individual elements.  Mathematically this is done with a
binary operation that takes two elements as inputs and returns a positive real
number as output,
\begin{alignat*}{6}
d :\; & X \times X& &\rightarrow& \; & \mathbb{R}^{+} &
\\
& x_{1}, x_{2} & &\mapsto& & d(x_{1}, x_{2}) &.
\end{alignat*}
In order for this operation to conform with out intuitive notions of distance
we need it to satisfy a few key properties.  For example the output should
vanish when comparing an element to itself,
$$
d(x_{1}, x_{2}) = 0
$$
when $x_{1} = x_{2}$.  At the same time the output should be non-zero when
comparing two distinct inputs,
$$
d(x_{1}, x_{2}) > 0
$$
when $x_{1} \ne x_{2}$.  The operation should also be symmetric in its inputs,
$$
d(x_{1}, x_{2}) = d(x_{2}, x_{1}),
$$
and for any three elements satisfy a _triangle inequality_,
$$
d(x_{1}, x_{3}) \le d(x_{1}, x_{2}) + d(x_{2}, x_{3}).
$$
If the operation satisfies all of these properties then we can consistently say
that the larger $d(x_{1}, x_{2})$ is the most distant $x_{1}$ is from $x_{2}$.

Any operation satisfying these criteria is known as a **distance function** or
**metric**.  A set equipped with a metric is denoted a **metric space**.

Because a metric is symmetric in its inputs it is insensitive to any ordering of
the elements.  In fact the distances defined by a metric complement the
arrangement defined by an ordering: while an ordering defines how elements are
arranged but not how far apart they are, a metric defines how far apart the
elements are but not their arrangement.  Together an ordering and metric define
a rigid arrangement of the elements.

One of the most important applications of a metric is formalizing notions of
_convergence_ and _limits_ in a set.  Consider for example a countably infinite
sequence of elements
$$
\{ x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{i}, \ldots \}.
$$
A metric quantifies how far these elements are from any other element $x \in X$,
$$
\{ r_{1}, r_{2}, \ldots, r_{i}, \ldots \}
=
\{ d(x_{1}, x), d(x_{2}, x), \ldots, d(x_{i}, x) \}.
$$
Intuitively if these distances decay towards zero then the sequence of elements
will move closer and closer to $x$.

More formally a sequence of elements **converges** to the **limit** $x$ if for
_any_ distance $\epsilon > 0$ we can go deep enough into the sequence that the
distances between the tail elements
$$
\{ x_{i'}, x_{i' + 1}, \ldots, x_{i' + i}, \ldots \}
$$
and the limiting element $x$ are all bounded by $\epsilon$,
\begin{align*}
d(x_{i'}, x) &< \epsilon
\\
d(x_{i' + 1}, x) &< \epsilon
\\
\ldots&
\\
d(x_{i' + i}, x) &< \epsilon
\\
\ldots&,
\end{align*}
no matter how small it might be (@fig-metric-convergence).  In other
words the elements of a convergent sequence will become arbitrarily close to
$x$, at least eventually.

![Equipping a set with a metric allows us to quantify when a sequence of
elements converges to a limiting element $x \in X$.  If the distance between the
sequential elements and the limiting element $x$ is eventually bounded by any
finite distance $\epsilon$ then the sequential elements will become arbitrarily
close to $x$.](
figures/structures/metric_convergence/metric_convergence){width=90% #fig-metric-convergence}

Convergent sequences can then be used to formally implement limits.  In
particular the notation $x' \rightarrow x$ corresponds to _any_ sequence of
elements that converges to $x$.  Limiting behavior is determined by how _all_ of
these convergent sequences behave.

### Topologies {#sec:topologies}

The distances defined by a metric endow a set with a rich diversity of useful
features.  Many of these features, however, can also be defined by
distinguishing certain subsets, avoiding the need for a metric entirely.

#### Open Balls {#sec:open-balls}

A metric can be used to construct special subsets.  The collection of all
elements within a distance $r$ from the element $x \in X$ defines a subset
$$
\mathsf{b}_{r}(x) = \{ x' \in X \mid d(x, x') < r \} \subseteq 2^{X}
$$
known as an **open ball** centered at $x$ with radius $r$.  Any open ball with
zero radius reduces to the empty set.

Including the elements exactly at a distance $r$ from $x$ defines a slightly
larger subset
$$
\bar{\mathsf{b}}_{r}(x) = \{ x' \in X \mid d(x, x') \le r \} \in 2^{X}
$$
known as a **closed ball** centered at $x$ with radius $r$.  By themselves the
elements exactly a distance of $r$ away from $x$ define yet another subset
$$
\delta \mathsf{b}_{r}(x) = \{ x' \in X \mid d(x, x') = r \} \in 2^{X}
$$
that defines the **boundary** of the open and closed balls.  An open ball
becomes a closed ball when we combine it with this boundary,
$$
\bar{\mathsf{b}}_{r}(x) = \mathsf{b}_{r}(x) \cup \delta \mathsf{b}_{r}(x).
$$

Open balls quantify which elements are in the _proximity_ of the central element
without directly referencing the metric.  More formally every open ball centered
at $x \in X$ with finite but potentially arbitrarily small radius defines a
**metric neighborhood** of $x$.  The smaller a metric neighborhood is the closer
the elements it contains will be to the central element $x$.  To emphasize the
possibility of arbitrarily small metric neighborhoods I will use $\epsilon$
instead of $r$ when referring to the open ball radii that define metric
neighborhoods.

![Open balls centered at $x \in X$ define neighborhoods of elements that are
close to $x$.  The smaller the neighborhood the closer the elements are to $x$.](
figures/structures/metric_topology/continuous_neighborhoods/continuous_neighborhoods){
width=50% #fig-metric-continuous-neighborhoods}

The interaction of these neighborhoods reveals quite a bit about the
relationships between individual elements in a metric space.  For example
because any pair of distinct elements are separated by a finite distance they
can always be contained in non-overlapping metric neighborhoods
(@fig-metric-separation).  In other words metric neighborhoods are able to
_distinguish_ individual elements from each other.

![For any two elements $x_{1}, x_{2} \in X$ in a metric space we can always find
radii $\epsilon_{1} + \epsilon_{2} < d(x_{1}, x_{2})$ such that the open balls
$\mathsf{b}_{\epsilon_{1}}(x_{1})$ and $\mathsf{b}_{\epsilon_{2}}(x_{2})$
containing the two elements will not overlap.  Consequently metric neighborhoods
are always able to separate individual elements.](
figures/structures/metric_topology/separation/separation){
width=50% #fig-metric-separation}

Moreover we can use metric neighborhoods to define convergent sequences.  Recall
that, by definition, we can always go deep enough into a convergent sequence
that the tail elements
$$
\{ x_{i'}, x_{i' + 1}, \ldots, x_{i' + i}, \ldots \}
$$
will be closer to the limiting element $x$ than any distance $\epsilon > 0$,
\begin{align*}
d(x_{i'}, x) &< \epsilon
\\
d(x_{i' + 1}, x) &< \epsilon
\\
\ldots&
\\
d(x_{i' + i}, x) &< \epsilon
\\
\ldots&,
\end{align*}
This, however, is equivalent to requiring that those tail elements are contained
in the open ball $\mathsf{b}_{\epsilon}(x)$ centered at the limiting element,
$$
\{ x_{i'}, x_{i' + 1}, \ldots, x_{i' + i}, \ldots \}
\in \mathsf{b}_{\epsilon}(x).
$$
In other words a sequence will converge to the limit $x$ if and only if the
elements in the sequence are eventually contained in _any_ metric neighborhood
of $x$ (@fig-metric-neighborhood-convergence).

![On a metric space a sequence of elements converges to the limit $x \in X$
if and only if we can always go deep enough in the sequence that all subsequent
elements will be contained in any metric neighborhood.](
figures/structures/metric_topology/convergence/convergence){
width=90% #fig-metric-neighborhood-convergence}

Metric neighborhoods can also be used to formalize intuitive notions of
_continuous_ and _discrete_ metric spaces.  For example we can formalize the
notion of a continuum by requiring that every element $x \in X$ is surrounded by
elements at any arbitrary distance, at least up to some potentially maximum
distance.  More succictly for _every_ element $x \in X$ and distance
$0 < \epsilon \le \epsilon_{\max}$ we should be able to find another element
$x' \in X$ satisfying
$$
d(x, x') = \epsilon.
$$
This requirement, however, is equivalent to every metric neighborhood with
radius less than $\epsilon_{\max}$ defining a _distinct_ subset of $X$ because
increasing the radius will always introduce new elements.  This then implies
that every metric neighborhood of $x$, no matter how small, must contain more
elements than just $x$.  In other words no metric neighborhood in such a space
will reduce to an atomic set.

On the other hand the elements in a discrete metric space are not separated by
arbitrary distances.  Instead they are separated only by certain distances,
specifically distances bounded below by some minimum distance.  In this case
many metric neighborhoods are degenerate, reducing to the same subsets of $X$
(@fig-metric-discrete-neighborhoods).  Moreover any metric neighborhood with
radius smaller than the minimum distance will reduce to the atomic set
containing only the central element.  These smallest neighborhoods isolate the
elements from each other.

![The elements in a discrete metric space are separated by some finite minimum
distance, which is equivalent to many metric neighborhoods degenerating into
the same subsets.  In particular the smallest metric neighborhoods all
degenerate to the atomic set which contains only the central element.](
figures/structures/metric_topology/discrete_neighborhoods/discrete_neighborhoods){
width=90% #fig-metric-discrete-neighborhoods}

#### Open Sets {#sec:open-sets}

The concept of an open subsets can also be generalized beyond just open balls.
Consider for example a subset $\mathsf{x} \subset X$ and an element
$x \in \mathsf{x}$.  If $x$ is contained in a metric neighborhood that is itself
contained in the subset,
$$
x \in \mathsf{b}_{\epsilon}(x) \subset \mathsf{x},
$$
then we can move away from $x$ without ever leaving $\mathsf{x}$.  When _every_
element in $\mathsf{x}$ can be contained by at least one metric neighborhood
that is also contained in $\mathsf{x}$ then we can always move closer to the
edge of the subset without leaving it.

A key consequence of this construction is that these subsets, just like the open
balls, do not contain any boundary elements.  Consequently they make a natural
generalization for **open subsets** (@fig-open-subset).  We can then define
**closed subsets** as the complements of any open subset.  Closed subsets are
characterized by their inclusion of elements whose metric neighborhoods all leak
out into the surrounding set (@fig-closed-subset).

![In a metric space every element of an open subset can be contained by a metric
neighborhood that is itself fully contained by the open subset.  As we move
closer and closer to the boundary of an open subset the metric neighborhood will
become smaller but never vanish, allowing us to make progressively smaller moves
towards the boundary without ever reaching it.](
figures/structures/metric_topology/open_subset/open_subset){
width=90% #fig-open-subset}

![A closed subset of a metric space contains boundary elements whose metric
neighborhoods always leak out of the subset.](
figures/structures/metric_topology/closed_subset/closed_subset){
width=50% #fig-closed-subset}

Unfortunately this construction does introduce a few subtleties.  Unlike the
colloquial use of "open" and "closed" these definitions of open subsets and
closed subsets are not exact opposites.  If a subset and its complement are both
open then they will, by definition, be both open and closed at the same time.
Because mathematicians have no shame these subsets are referred to as "clopen"
subsets.  Moreover open subsets and closed subsets are both exceptional in the
power set; in general only _some_ subsets will be open, closed, or both, and
most subsets will be neither open nor closed.

Unlike open balls these metric-derived open subsets are _closed_ under unions
and intersections.  If $\mathsf{x}_{1}$ and $\mathsf{x}_{2}$ are both open
subsets then $\mathsf{x}_{1} \cup \mathsf{x}_{2}$ will also an open subset.  In
fact the union of any _countably infinite_ number of open subsets will be open.
Likewise if $\mathsf{x}_{1}$ and $\mathsf{x}_{2}$ are both open subsets then
$\mathsf{x}_{1} \cap \mathsf{x}_{2}$ will also be an open subset.  Indeed the
intersection of any _finite_ number of open subsets will also be open but, in an
unfortunate asymmetry, the intersection of a countably infinite number of open
subsets might not be open.

Open subsets provide an immediate way to generalize the notion of neighborhood
beyond open balls.  If we define a general neighborhood of $x$ to be _any_ open
subset that contains $x$ then we will be able to derive many of the same
properties as metric neighborhoods, and hence the underlying metric.  For
example two elements can be separated by metric neighborhoods if and only if
they can be separated by open subsets more generally.  Similarly every sequence
that converges to the limit $x$ is eventually contained not just by every metric
neighborhood of $x$ by also by every general neighborhood of $x$.

While different metrics define different metric neighborhoods around each
element, those different metric neighborhoods can sometimes end up defining the
_same_ open subsets (@fig-equivalent-open-subsets).  Because those open subsets
completely characterize properties like separation and convergence the metrics
that yield the same open subsets will all share those properties!  Working
directly with a collection of open subsets allows us to avoid the idiosyncrasies
of any particular metric and isolate the properties common to _all_ compatible
metrics.

![Different metrics define different metric neighborhoods, but in some cases
those different metric neighborhoods end up defining the same collection of
open subsets.  Any property defined by those common open subsets will be shared
by all of the compatible metrics.](
figures/structures/metric_topology/equivalent_open_subsets/equivalent_open_subsets){
width=90% #fig-equivalent-open-subsets}

#### General Topologies {#sec:general-topology}

Once we can define interesting properties directly from open subsets a natural
question is whether or not those open subsets need to derived from any existing
structure in the first place.  Indeed we can introduce all kinds of interesting
properties to a set by equipping it directly with a self-contained collection of
distinguished subsets.

A **topology** is any collection of subsets
$$
\mathfrak{t}
= \{ \emptyset, \mathsf{x}_{1}, \ldots, \mathsf{x}_{i}, \ldots, X \} \in 2^{X}
$$
that contains the empty set and the full set, is closed under countably infinite
unions, and finite intersections.  Any set equipped with a topology is referred
to as a **topological space**.

The distinguished subsets that define a topology are generally referred to as
**open subsets** even if they are not derived from a metric.  If the open
subsets in a topology are derived from a metric, or _can be_ derived from a
metric, then we refer to the topology as a **metric topology**.

Non-empty subsets in a topology provide the ultimate generalization of
neighborhoods.  Every subset in a topology that contains the element $x \in X$
defines a neighborhood of $x$, with each neighborhood providing some
quantification of which elements in the set are in the proximity of $x$
(@fig-continuous-general-neighborhoods).  Smaller neighborhoods imply a stronger
sense of proximity than larger neighborhoods.

![The subsets in a topology define a general notion of neighborhood.  Any
subset in the topology that contains an element $x \in X$ defines a neighborhood
of elements in the proximity of $x$.](
figures/structures/general_topology/neighborhoods/neighborhoods){
width=50% #fig-continuous-general-neighborhoods}

The overlap of topological neighborhoods around distinct elements determines
how well the topology can distinguish those elements from each other.  Larger
topologies contain more neighborhoods that better resolve the individual
elements in the underlying set than smaller topologies.  In other words the
larger the topology the closer we can zoom into the individual elements.

For example the smallest topology, known as the **trivial topology**, contains
only the empty set and the full set,
$$
\tau = \{ \emptyset, X \}.
$$
In this case there is only one neighborhood, and that neighborhood is shared by
_all_ of the elements in $X$.  Consequently the topology is not able to
discriminate any element from any other element.

At the other extreme the **discrete topology** contains the entire power set,
$$
\tau = 2^{X}.
$$
Because the discrete topology contains every atomic set each element can be
contained in a neighborhood by itself, allowing us to zoom into each element
individually and isolate it from every other element in $X$
(@fig-general-discrete-neighborhoods).  This generalizes the behavior of
discrete metric spaces that we encountered in
[Section 1.2.4.1](@sec:open-balls).

![The discrete topology contains all of the atomic sets which define
neighborhoods that completely isolate each element from every other element.](
figures/structures/general_topology/discrete_topology/discrete_topology){
width=50% #fig-general-discrete-neighborhoods}

Particularly well-behaved topologies include enough subsets that every pair of
elements can be contained by non-overlapping neighborhoods
(@fig-general-separation), mirroring the separation afforded by open subsets on
metric spaces.  In other words these **Hausdorff topologies** are able to
distinguish every element from every other element.

![A Hausdorff topology includes enough subsets that every pair of elements
$x_{1}, x_{2} \in X$ can be contained by at least one set of neighborhoods that
don't overlap with each other.  More formally
$x_{1} \in \mathsf{x}_{1} \subset X$ and $x_{2} \in \mathsf{x}_{2} \subset X$
with $\mathsf{x}_{1} \cap \mathsf{x}_{2} = \emptyset$.](
figures/structures/general_topology/separation/separation){
width=50% #fig-general-separation}

The continuous metric spaces discussed in [Section 1.2.4.1](@sec:open-balls)
are generalized by topologies that fall in between the extreme trivial and
discrete topologies.  They contain enough subsets to be Hausdorff but not so
many to be discrete, allowing us to zoom in arbitrary close to each element but
never isolate them completely from neighboring elements.  The precise subsets
included in these intermediate topologies then endow a set a certain notions of
"shape".

For example the half-open line interval
$$
[0, 1) = \{ x \in \mathbb{R} \mid 0 \le x < 1 \}
$$
is a Hausdorff topological space with open subsets defined by half-open
subintervals
$$
[a, b) = \{ x \in \mathbb{R} \mid 0 \le a \le x < b < 1 \}
$$
and their unions.  In particular the half-open subintervals
$$
[0, \epsilon) = \{ x \in \mathbb{R} \mid 0 \le x < \epsilon < 1 \}
$$
contain elements near lower boundary but not elements near the upper boundary,
separating the two ends from each other and giving the line is distinctive
shape (@fig-line-topology).  Removing these subintervals gives _another_
Hausdorff topology, but one where the obstructions between the elements near the
lower boundary and the elements near the upper boundary have been removed.  This
effectively connects the two ends together, endowing the set not with the shape
of a line but rather the shape of a circle (@fig-circle-topology)!

::: {#fig-line-verses-circle layout="[ [-5, 45, 45, -5] ]"}
![](figures/structures/general_topology/line_topology/line_topology){
#fig-line-topology}

![](figures/structures/general_topology/circle_topology/circle_topology){
#fig-circle-topology}

The precise subsets included in a topology endow the underlying set with subtle
notions of shape.  (a) A line is an uncountably infinite set equipped with a
topology that contains enough subsets to strongly separate the ends from each
other.  (b) Removing those particular subsets, shown here in light red, gives a
smaller topology where the ends are in closer proximity, giving the same set the
shape of a circle.
:::

Convergence on topological spaces can also be defined in the same way as it is
on metric spaces, replacing the neighborhoods derived from open balls to the
neighborhoods defined by the topology (@fig-general-convergence).  The
generality of topological structure, however, does come at a cost: if a topology
cannot discriminate between individual elements than the limit of a convergent
sequence might not be unique.  Instead unique limits are guaranteed by only
Hausdorff topologies.

![The subsets in a topology can be used to define convergent sequences in the
same way that the open subsets in a metric space can: a sequence of elements
converges to the limit $x \in X$ if and only if we can always go deep enough in
the sequence that all subsequent elements can be contained in any topological
neighborhood of $x$.  For many topologies, however, a sequence can converge to
multiple elements at the same time.  Unique limits are a feature of only some
topologies.](
figures/structures/general_topology/convergence/convergence){
width=90% #fig-general-convergence}

A subtle benefit of this topological definition of convergence is that because
it doesn't require a metric is also doesn't require us to define the positive
real numbers.  This can be helpful for avoiding circular logic in more technical
mathematical analyses.

#### The Practical Uses of Topology

In general topologies can be used to equip a set with all kinds of complicated
structure, defining sophisticated spaces that far exceed our intuitions.
Indeed the construction and classification of elaborate topological spaces is a
major focus of more abstract mathematics.  Because most introductions to
topology focus on these objectives the subject has developed an imposing
reputation of inaccessibility, if not outright irrelevance, to more applied
aspirations.

Topology, however, can be a powerful tool in practice by helping us to
better understand the familiar spaces that appear in more applied mathematics.
Specifically a given topology can be used to quantify which behaviors will be
_shared_ by different choices of other structures, such as orderings and
metrics, and which behaviors are particular to those choices.

For example if a topology is not Hausdorff then we won't be able to distinguish
between individual elements well enough to consistently define a metric that
assigns non-zero distances $d(x_{1}, x_{2}) > 0$ to every pair of distinct
elements $x_{1} \ne x_{2}$.  In other words _every_ well-defined metric space
must also be a Hausdorff topological space.  Consequently _every_ metric space
shares the properties that can be derived from Hausdorff topological structure
alone, such as separation of elements by neighborhoods and uniqueness of
convergent sequence limits.

Some metric spaces have even more topological similarities.  In
[Section 1.2.4.2](@sec:open-sets) we saw that different metrics on the
same set can define the same open sets, and hence the same metric topology.
Different metric spaces that induce the same metric topology are particularly
alike, sharing every property that can be defined by that common topology.  For
example on metric spaces with the same topology convergent sequences will not
only enjoy unique limits, they will share the _same_ limits.

Similarly all spaces equipped with the topology of a line that we explored in
[Section 1.2.4.3](@sec:general-topology) will share the same basic linear
"shape" regardless of any compatible metric structure we introduce, while all
spaces equipped with the topology of a circle will exhibit the same circular
"shape".  Different metrics can warp how far apart the elements are from each
other but they cannot disrupt those topologically-derived shapes.

In other words working with topological properties allows us to isolate all of
the behaviors shared by spaces equipped with compatible structures and disregard
the idiosyncrasies any particular choice of that structure.  Because of this
topological structure is often interpreted as more _fundamental_ than other
structures.  From this perspective the foundation of a space is a set equipped
with a particular topology.  Any additional structure, such as an ordering,
algebra, or metric just builds on top of that foundation.

# Prototypical Spaces {#sec:proto-spaces}

The more structure we endow onto a set the richer its properties will be.  That
richness offers not only mathematical but also interpretational opportunities:
indeed the spaces that are most common in practice are absolutely spoiled with
structure.  In section we'll review the spaces that arise most often in
mathematical modeling.

## Power Set

The subsets of any set naturally feature a surprising amount of structure that
we can use to elevate the power set into a space.

For example subsets can be partially ordered by inclusion.  A subset
$\mathsf{x}_{1} \subset X$ is smaller than a subset $\mathsf{x}_{2} \subset X$
if $\mathsf{x}_{1} \subset \mathsf{x}_{2}$, and larger if
$\mathsf{x}_{2} \subset \mathsf{x}_{1}$.  Two subsets that only partially
overlap fall into the same place in the ordering.  For any set the empty
set will always the smallest subset and the full set will always the largest.

The union and intersection operations introduce algebraic structure, known as a
**Boolean algebraic structure**, to the power set.  They are both commutative,
\begin{align*}
\mathsf{x}_{1} \cup \mathsf{x}_{2} &= \mathsf{x}_{2} \cup \mathsf{x}
\\
\mathsf{x}_{1} \cap \mathsf{x}_{2} &= \mathsf{x}_{2} \cap \mathsf{x},
\end{align*}
and associative,
\begin{align*}
(\mathsf{x}_{1} \cup \mathsf{x}_{2}) \cup \mathsf{x}_{3}
&=
\mathsf{x}_{1} \cup (\mathsf{x}_{2} \cup \mathsf{x}_{3})
\\
(\mathsf{x}_{1} \cap \mathsf{x}_{2}) \cap \mathsf{x}_{3}
&=
\mathsf{x}_{1} \cap (\mathsf{x}_{2} \cap \mathsf{x}_{3}).
\end{align*}

Both operations are also unital but with different identity elements.  For
example the identity element for the union operation is empty set,
$$
\mathsf{x} \cup \emptyset = \emptyset \cup \mathsf{x} = \mathsf{x},
$$
while the identity element for the intersection operation is the full set,
$$
\mathsf{x} \cap X = X \cap \mathsf{x} = \mathsf{x}.
$$
Interestingly no elements but these identity elements admit inverse elements;
no union can reduce a non-empty input subset to the empty set and no
intersection can elevate a non-full input subset to the full set.

At the same time the union and intersection are null operators.  Because the
union of any subset with the full set returns the full set,
$$
\mathsf{x} \cup X = X \cup \mathsf{x} = X,
$$
the full set is an absorbing element.  Similarly because the intersection of
any subset with the empty set is the empty set,
$$
\mathsf{x} \cap \emptyset = \emptyset \cap \mathsf{x} = X,
$$
the empty set is an absorbing element.

These operations are also compatible with each other -- not only do unions
distribute across intersections,
$$
\mathsf{x}_{3} \cup ( \mathsf{x}_{1} \cap \mathsf{x}_{2} )
=
(\mathsf{x}_{3} \cup \mathsf{x}_{1}) \cap (\mathsf{x}_{3} \cup \mathsf{x}_{2}),
$$
but also intersections distribute across unions,
$$
\mathsf{x}_{3} \cap ( \mathsf{x}_{1} \cup \mathsf{x}_{2} )
=
(\mathsf{x}_{3} \cap \mathsf{x}_{1}) \cup (\mathsf{x}_{3} \cap \mathsf{x}_{2}).
$$

We can equip a power set with metrics and topologies, but the power set itself
does not motivate any particular choice of these structures on its own.  That
said metrics and topologies endowed on the underlying set can be used to derive
compatible metrics and topologies on the power set.

## Integers

The **integers**, denoted $\mathbb{Z}$, are the prototypical discrete space
which makes them particularly useful for modeling discrete quantities and
indexing sequences of objects.  That said despite their ubiquity we often take
their defining structures for granted.

Formally the integers are built from a countably infinite set of elements
equipped with a strict ordering, algebra, metric, and topology.  The algebraic
structure is given by the familiar arithmetic operations of addition and
multiplication that are compatible with the ordering.  We can also define
additive inverses, and hence subtraction, but we cannot define division because
the multiplicative inverses don't exist unless we expand the space to include
fractions.

This algebraic structure can also be used to define a metric as
$$
d(x_{1}, x_{2})
= \sqrt{ (x_{1} - x_{2}) \cdot (x_{1} - x_{2}) }
= | x_{1} - x_{2} |.
$$
In this case the distance between every sequential pair of integers is the same,
\begin{align*}
d(x_{n + 1}, x_{n})
&= | x_{n + 1} - x_{n} |
\\
&= | (x_{n} + 1) - x_{n} |
\\
&= | 1 |
\\
&= 1,
\end{align*}
endowing the space with a particular uniformity.

Because this metric enforces a minimum distance between every pair of elements
it is compatible with the discrete topology.  In particular the atomic sets in
the discrete topology maintain a strong separation between even neighboring
elements.

This characterization of the integers is all well and good until we consider
permuting the elements.  Sorting the elements differently changes the ordering
and algebraic operations, and the modified algebraic structure can define a
different metric structure.  In general only the discrete topology survives.

Despite all of this chaos, however, the behavior of this new space still
conforms with our intuitions about the integers.  In other words we've reached a
bit of an existential ambiguity.  Every countably infinite set equipped with the
discrete topology and _any_ choice of compatible strict ordering, arithmetic
operations, and metric defines a space which exhibits all of the features we
expect of the integers!

This leaves us with two possible interpretations of the "integers".  On one hand
we can interpret the integers not as a single space but rather a _class_ of
spaces, with each choice of compatible non-topological structure defining a
_distinct_ instance.  From this perspective we can't speak about _the_ integers
so much as _which_ integers we use in any given application.

Alternatively we can think of the integers as a single _flexible_ space with the
different choices of non-topological structure defining different
_configurations_.  In this case it does make sense to talk about _the_ integers,
but at the same that doesn't specify a configuration and hence how the integers
should be used in practice.

Regardless of which interpretation we embrace, "the" integers admit a few
particularly useful subspaces.  In particular we can construct the
**natural numbers**,
$$
\mathbb{N} = \{ x \in \mathbb{Z} \mid x \ge 0 \},
$$
by removing the elements smaller than zero, and the
**strictly positive natural numbers**
$$
\mathbb{N}^{+} = \{ x \in \mathbb{Z} \mid x > 0 \}
$$
by removing the zero element as well.  These subspaces inherit ordering, metric,
and topological structure from the integers but the algebraic structure will
is complicated a bit.  For example we can't consistently define subtraction on
the natural numbers because the difference between two positive integers can be
negative, which falls outside of $\mathbb{N}$.

## Real Lines

The prototypical model for a continuum that appears to contain endless points no
matter how closely we examine it is the **real line**, $\mathbb{R}$, which is
also known as the **real numbers** and a **one-dimensional Euclidean space**.
This space sets the stage for important constructions like differential and
integral calculus, but it also exhibits some subtle properties that can
compromise our intuitions and require a bit of careful technical detail at times
to avoid inconsistent behavior.

Formally the real line is built from an uncountably infinite set of elements
that, like the integers, is equipped with a strict ordering, algebra, metric,
and topology.  The algebraic structure includes addition and multiplication
operators which can also be be used to define corresponding subtraction and
division operators.

At the same time the binary multiplication operator also satisfies the criteria
for a scalar multiplication operator, making the real line a vector space as
well.  From a linear algebraic perspective we can interpret a real line not as a
collection of points but rather a collection of arrows stretching from the zero
to each point.

As with the integers the algebraic structure on the real line can be used to
construct a metric,
$$
d(x_{1}, x_{2}) = \sqrt{ (x_{1} - x_{2}) \cdot (x_{1} - x_{2}) },
$$
which then defines a compatible metric topology.

Unfortunately this construction is not unique, and the real line suffers from
the same interpretational ambiguity as the integers.  Every uncountably infinite
set equipped with a certain non-discrete, Hausdorff topology and _any_ choice of
compatible ordering, algebra, and metric defines a space that behaves
like a real line.  Consequently we have to accept that $\mathbb{R}$ does not
completely specify a space.

On one hand we can take $\mathbb{R}$ to denote a class of real lines, with
infinitely many distinct realizations defined by different choices of ordering,
algebra, and metric.  On the other hand we can interpret $\mathbb{R}$ as a
single, flexible space that can be configured in an infinite number of different
ways by choosing different auxiliary structures.  In this latter perspective the
different configurations are also known as different **parameterizations** of
the real line.

The power set of a real line contains a wealth of subsets that we can use to
construct useful subspaces.  For example the integers are a subset of the real
line, $\mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{R}$.  We can also define the
**positive real line** as
$$
\mathbb{R}^{+} = \{ x \in \mathbb{R} \mid x \ge 0 \}.
$$
More generally we can define **intervals** that contain all points within an
upper and lower bound.  **Open intervals** do not contain the bounds,
$$
(x_{1}, x_{2}) =
\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \mid x_{1} < x < x_{2} \}
$$
while **closed intervals** do,
$$
[x_{1}, x_{2}] =
\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \mid x_{1} \le x \le x_{2} \}.
$$
All of these subspaces inherit topological, ordering, and metric structure from
the initial real line, but they may not inherit all of the algebraic structure.

Regardless of the interpretation we can use the metric structure of a real line
to construct a useful visualization of the space.  In particular any partition
of the real line into equally long intervals,
$$
\ldots, x_{-i}, \ldots, x_{-1}, x_{0}, x_{1}, \ldots, x_{i}, \ldots
$$
with
$$
d(x_{i + 1}, x_{i}) = \delta,
$$
defines a **grid** that can be used to communicate its basic structure
(@fig-real-line-grid).

![A grid of equally distant elements in a real line partitions the space into
equally long intervals that communicates the metric structure.](
figures/real_line_grid/real_line_grid){width=50% #fig-real-line-grid}

## Extended Real Lines

One limitation of a real line is that it does not contains points that
_approach_ either negative or positive infinity, but not points that represent
those limits directly.  An **extended real line** resolves introduces two new
elements, one smaller than all elements in the initial real line to represent
negative infinity and one larger than all of the elements to represent positive
infinity.  In other words we can interpret an extended real line as the closed
interval $[-\infty, \infty]$ while a real line is the corresponding open
interval $(-\infty, \infty)$.

The inclusion of these two points does introduce some slight technical
challenges.  For example the algebraic structure is complicated by the fact that
neither $-\infty$ nor $+\infty$ have well-defined additive or multiplicative
inverses, unlike most other points.  To avoid any inconsistencies we have to
slightly tweak any structure derived from these operations, such as the metric
and the corresponding metric topology.

Appending positive infinite to a positive real line defines an
**extended positive real line** $[0, +\infty]$.  We have already been sneakily
introduced to the extended positive real line in
[Chapter One](https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/chapters_html/probability_on_finite_spaces.html).
There we used it to model the potentially infinite reservoir that we want to
allocate across a finite set.  In the next chapter we will use it model a
potentially infinite reservoir to be allocated across any set.

# Relating Spaces

One we have defined spaces a natural question is how we can relate different
spaces to each other.  This requires relating not only the elements in the set
but also any structure we have endowed onto that set.

## Relating Sets

A **function**, also know as a **map** or **transformation**, is a relation
between the elements of some _input_ set and the elements of some _output_ set
(@fig-function).  Mathematically we specify functions as $f : X \rightarrow Y$
where $X$ denotes the input set and $Y$ denotes the output set.  If we want to
be more detailed then we can also write
\begin{alignat*}{6}
f :\; & X & &\rightarrow& \; & Y &
\\
& x & &\mapsto& & y = f(x) &,
\end{alignat*}
where $x \in X$ is a variable taking values in the input set and $y \in Y$ is a
variable taking values in the output set.  This allows us to, for example,
detail how exactly the function transforms $x$ into $y$.

![A function relates elements of an input set $X$ to elements of an output set
$Y$.](figures/maps/function/function){width=90% #fig-function}

One potential source of confusion when working with functions is mistaking a
function $f : X \rightarrow Y$ with the _evaluation_ of a function on a given
input variable, $y = f(\tilde{x}) \in Y$.

### Classifying Functions

There are many ways to relate the elements from a given input set to the
elements of a given output set.  Some relations, however, are more useful than
others.  In order to understand the potential utility of different functions it
helps to categorize them based on some basic properties.

For example if each input element maps to one, and only one, output element then
equal function outputs will always imply equal function inputs and vice versa.
More formally when $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ if and only if $x_1 = x_2$ we say that the
function $f$ is **injective** (@fig-injectivity).  Non-injective functions are
also known as **many-to-one** functions.

::: {#fig-injectivity layout="[ [-5, 90, -5], [-5, 90, -5] ]"}
![](figures/maps/injective/injective){#fig-injective}

![](figures/maps/non_injective/non_injective){#fig-non-injective}

An (a) injective function maps each distinct input element to a distinct output
element. A (b) non-injective function maps two or more input elements to the
same output element.
:::

Similarly if each element of $Y$ is the output of evaluating $f$ on some input
element in $X$ then the function is said to be **surjective**
(@fig-surjectivity).

::: {#fig-surjectivity layout="[ [-5, 90, -5], [-5, 90, -5] ]"}
![](figures/maps/surjective/surjective){#fig-surjective}

![](figures/maps/non_surjective/non_surjective){#fig-non-surjective}

A (a) surjective function maps input elements to _every_ element in the output
set. A (b) non-surjective function maps input elements to only a subset of
the output set.
:::

When a function is both injective and surjective then _every_ output element is
uniquely paired with a single input element.  In other words the input set and
the output set are in perfect correspondence.  These functions are known as
**bijective** functions.

To demonstrate these behaviors let's consider four different functions that
map the elements in a real interval $X = [0, 1]$ into the elements of another
real interval $Y = [0, 1]$.

::: {#fig-function-examples layout="[ [-5, 45, 45, -5], [-5, 45, 45, -5] ]"}
![](figures/maps/graphs/f1/f1){#fig-f1}

![](figures/maps/graphs/f2/f2){#fig-f2}

![](figures/maps/graphs/f3/f3){#fig-f3}

![](figures/maps/graphs/f4/f4){#fig-f4}

Injective functions map distinct input elements to distinct output elements
while surjective functions map into every output element at least once.  Here
(a) is neither injective nor surjective, (b) is injective but not surjective,
(c) is not injective but is surjective, and (d) is both injective and
surjective.
:::

The function (@fig-f1)
\begin{alignat*}{6}
f_1 :\; & [0, 1] & &\rightarrow& \; & [0, 1] &
\\
& x & &\mapsto& & \frac{1}{1 + 4 \cdot x \cdot (1 - x)} &
\end{alignat*}
is not injective because both $x$ and $1 - x$ map to the same output element.
Moreover it is not surjective because no input element will ever yield an output
less than $y = \frac{1}{2}$.

Like $f_1$ the function (@fig-f2)
\begin{alignat*}{6}
f_2 :\; & [0, 1] & &\rightarrow& \; & [0, 1] &
\\
& x & &\mapsto& & \frac{1}{1 + x} &
\end{alignat*}
outputs only values larger than or equal to $y = \frac{1}{2}$ and hence is not
surjective.  On the other hand each distinct input element maps to a distinct
output element so unlike the function $f_1$ the function $f_2$ is injective.

This function (@fig-f3)
\begin{alignat*}{6}
f_3 :\; & [0, 1] & &\rightarrow& \; & [0, 1] &
\\
& x & &\mapsto& & x \cdot (1 - x) &
\end{alignat*}
shares the same symmetry as $f_1$ -- because both $x$ and $1 - x$ map to the
same output element neither function is injective.  Unlike $f_1$ the output
elements of $f_3$ completely fill up the output set, making $f_3$ a surjective
function.

Finally the function (@fig-f4)
\begin{alignat*}{6}
f_4 :\; & [0, 1] & &\rightarrow& \; & [0, 1] &
\\
& x & &\mapsto& & x \cdot x &
\end{alignat*}
is both injective _and_ surjective, and hence bijective.

Functions that map the input set into itself, $f : X \rightarrow X$, are known
as **automorphisms**.  In other words a bijective automorphism doesn't change
$X$ but may permute the elements around.  This permutation can in turn warp any
structure endowed on $X$.

The **identity function** is the unique bijective automorphism that maps every
element $x \in X$ back to itself,
\begin{alignat*}{6}
\text{Id} :\; & X & &\rightarrow& \; & X &
\\
& x & &\mapsto& & x &,
\end{alignat*}
leaving the set completely unchanged. When working with algebraic spaces we have
to be careful to distinguish between the identity _function_ that maps an input
set into itself and the identity _element_ of that set.

### Function Inverses

Bijective functions are particularly special because we can always undo their
action and recover the input set.  Formally if $f : X \rightarrow Y$ is a
bijection then we can define an **inverse function** $f^{-1} : Y \rightarrow X$
such that
$$
f^{-1}(f(x)) = x
$$
for all $x \in X$.  In other words no information is lost when we map from $X$
to $Y$ allowing us to completely recover $X$ again if needed
(@fig-function-inverse).

![A bijective function $f$ identifies every output element with one and only
input element.  Consequently we can construct an inverse function that takes
each output element back to the corresponding input element.](
figures/maps/inverse/inverse){width=90% #fig-function-inverse}

As with the term "identity" we have to be careful when using the term "inverse"
in the context of algebraic spaces.  In particular we have to take care to
distinguish between inverse _functions_ between two sets and inverse _elements_
in either of those two sets.

Without bijectivity we cannot define inverse functions that map distinct output
elements to distinct input elements.  If a function is not surjective then some
output elements might not be related to _any_ input elements.  On the other hand
if a function is not injective then some output elements may be related to
_multiple_ input elements.

Even if a function is not bijective, however, we can still define a generalized
notion of inversion.  Although we cannot generally relate elements $y \in Y$ to
unique elements of $X$ we can relate them to _subsets_ of $X$ that contain all
of the elements that map into $y$,
\begin{alignat*}{6}
f^{-1} :\; & Y & &\rightarrow& \; & 2^X &
\\
& y & &\mapsto& & f^{-1}(y) &.
\end{alignat*}
The subset $f^{-1}(y) \subset X$ corresponding to a particular output element
$y \in Y$ is referred to as a _preimage_ or _fiber_ of $y$ (@fig-fibers).
Intuitively we can reconstruct the entire input set by "weaving" these fibers
together,
$$
X = \cup_{y \in Y} f^{-1}(y).
$$

![Even if a function is not bijective we can define a generalized inverse that
maps each output element $y \in Y$ to a fiber of input elements
$f^{-1}(y) \subset X$ that all map into $y$.  In general these fibers can be
empty, consist of a single input element, or consist of multiple input
elements.](
figures/maps/fibers/fibers){width=90% #fig-fibers}

When $f$ is not surjective then some fibers may be empty, but if $f$ is
surjective then all fibers will be non-empty.  At the same time if a function is
not injective then fibers will generally contain multiple elements, but if it is
injective then all of the fibers will contain either one element or no elements.
The fibers of bijective functions contain one and only one element: the result
of evaluating the inverse function.

### Function Composition

When defining a function inverse we had to take the output of a function
$y = f(x)$ and used it as input to a second function,
$f^{-1}(y) = f^{-1}(f(x))$.  This chaining of functions with compatible input
and output sets together can be applied much more generally and is known as
**function composition** or just **composition** for short.

More formally given the functions $f : X \rightarrow Y$ and
$g : Y \rightarrow Z$ we can construct the composition of $f$ with $g$ as the
function
\begin{alignat*}{6}
g \circ f :\; & X & &\rightarrow& \; & Z &
\\
& x & &\mapsto& & z = g(f(x)) &.
\end{alignat*}

![The functions $f : X \rightarrow Y$ and $g : Y \rightarrow Z$ can be chained
together to map an input element $x \in X$ to an output element $z \in Z$.  This
combined mapping defines the composite function $g \circ f$.](
figures/maps/composition/composition){width=90% #fig-composition}

Using this notation we can define an inverse function a bit more compactly as
$$
\text{Id} = f^{-1} \circ f.
$$
In words the composition of a bijective function with its inverse function is
the identify function.

## Relating Structures

Functions define how the elements of an input set transform into the elements
of an output set.  If we want to relate entire _spaces_, however, then we also
need to specify how the additional structures that define those spaces
transform along with the underlying elements.

To be more precise let $\mathfrak{x}$ denote whatever structure we endow on the
set $X$ so that our input space is fully described as $(X, \mathfrak{x})$.  In
order to fully define an output space we need to map input elements in $X$ to
output elements in $Y$ _and_ equip that output space with some structure
$\mathfrak{y}$.  We can choose that structure ourselves, or we can try to
derive it from the input structure $\mathfrak{x}$.

Fortunately maps between sets often _induce_ natural maps between structures,
allowing us to fully transform spaces without having to make additional
assumptions about how structures transform.  Unfortunately these induced maps
don't always give the structure we might expect.

### Pushforward and Pullback Relations

Consider a function $f : X \rightarrow Y$ that maps input elements into output
elements and a subset of the input space $\mathsf{x} \subset X$.  Applying $f$
to each element of $\mathsf{x}$ defines a subset of the output space
$\mathsf{y} \subset Y$,
$$
\mathsf{y} = \{ y \in Y \mid y = f(x) \text{ for some } x \in \mathsf{x} \}
$$
In other words the element-wise evaluation of $f$ implicitly defines a map from
input subsets to output subsets (@fig-set-pushforward)
\begin{alignat*}{6}
f_{*} :\; & 2^X & &\rightarrow& \; & 2^Y &
\\
& \mathsf{x} & &\mapsto& & \mathsf{y} = f_{*}(\mathsf{x}) &.
\end{alignat*}

If $f$ is not bijective then we cannot map output elements to unique input
elements.  We can, however, always map every output element to a, possibly
empty, collection of input elements $f^{-1}(y) \subset X$.  The union of the
fibers from all elements in an output subset $\mathsf{y} \subset Y$ defines
a subset of all of the input elements that map into $\mathsf{y}$,
$$
\mathsf{x} = \cup_{y \in \mathsf{y}} f^{-1}(y) \subset X,
$$
or equivalently
$$
\mathsf{x} = \{ x \in X \mid f(x) \in \mathsf{y} \}.
$$
Weaving together these fibers implicitly defines a map from output subsets to
input subsets (@fig-set-pullback)
\begin{alignat*}{6}
f^{*} :\; & 2^Y & &\rightarrow& \; & 2^X &
\\
& \mathsf{y} & &\mapsto& & \mathsf{x} = f^{*}(\mathsf{y}) &.
\end{alignat*}

::: {#fig-set-maps layout="[ [-5, 90, -5], [-5, 90, -5] ]"}
![](figures/maps/set_pushforward/set_pushforward){#fig-set-pushforward}

![](figures/maps/set_pullback/set_pullback){#fig-set-pullback}

The action of a function $f$ on individual elements induces an action on entire
subsets. In particular we can construct (a) a map from input subsets to output
subsets and (b) a map from output subsets to input subsets.
:::

Conveniently this pattern is not exceptional.  Sufficiently well-behaved
functions that map an input set into an output set often induce mappings from
objects defined over that input set to objects defined over that output set or
vice versa.  This includes not only subsets but also all of the structures that
elevate a set into a space that we introduced in [Section 1.2](@sec:structures).

To be a bit more formal let $X$ be the set defining an input space and
$\mathfrak{x}$ the particular structure, or structures, that elevates that set
to a space so that we can completely specify our space as $(X, \mathfrak{x})$.
Moreover denote the set of all structures that we can endow onto the input space
$X$ as $\mathfrak{X}$ and the set of all structures that we can endow onto the
output space $Y$ as $\mathfrak{Y}$.

The subset map $f_{*} : 2^X \rightarrow 2^Y$ that we constructed above
_pushes_ inputs subsets _forward_ along the action of the function $f$.
Analogously any relation between input structures and output structures induced
by $f : X \rightarrow Y$ that pushes forward input structures into compatible
output structures,
\begin{alignat*}{6}
f_{*} :\; & \mathfrak{X} & &\rightarrow& \; & \mathfrak{Y} &
\\
& \mathfrak{x} & &\mapsto& & \mathfrak{y} &,
\end{alignat*}
is denoted a **pushforward function along $f$**.  When the underlying function
$f$ is unambiguous then we also sometimes refer to $f_{*}$ as a
**pushforward function**.

As with functions that act on sets we have to be careful to distinguish between
pushforward _functions_ $f_{*} : \mathfrak{X} \rightarrow \mathfrak{Y}$ and the
particular pushforward _structure_ defined by evaluating the pushforward
function on a given input structure, $f_{*}(\mathfrak{x})$.  In other words if
there might be any ambiguity then we have to be careful to use "pushforward" as
an adjective, explicitly modifying "function" or "structure", and not an
ambiguous noun.

Similarly the subset map $f^{*} : 2^Y \rightarrow 2^X$ that we constructed above
_pulls_ output subsets _back_ against the action of the function $f$.  More
generally any relation between output structures and input structures induced by
$f : X \rightarrow Y$ that pulls output structures back into compatible input
structures,
\begin{alignat*}{6}
f^{*} :\; & \mathfrak{Y} & &\rightarrow& \; & \mathfrak{X} &
\\
& \mathfrak{y} & &\mapsto& & \mathfrak{x} &,
\end{alignat*}
is denoted a **pullback function against $f$**.  When the underlying function
$f$ is unambiguous then we also sometimes refer to $f^{*}$ as a
**pullback function**.

The existence of pushforward and pullback functions depends on how the defining
function $f : X \rightarrow Y$ interacts with the relevant structure.  In
general the nicer the function $f$ the more structure transforming functions it
induces.

#### Relating Orderings

Consider, for example, orderings.  When $f$ is an injective function every input
element $x$ corresponds to one and only one output element, $y = f(x)$.
Consequently any comparison between output elements can be translated to the
corresponding input elements.  If the output space $Y$ is equipped with an
ordering $<$ then we can define a compatible ordering on $X$ as
$$
x_{1} \;\; f^{*}\!\!< \; x_{2}
$$
if and only if
$$
f(x_{1}) < f(x_{2}).
$$
In other words every injective function allows us to pullback orderings on the
output set $<_{Y}$ to orderings on the input set $<_{X} = f^{*}\!\!<_{Y}$.

Unless $f$ is also surjective, and hence bijective, we cannot pushforward
orderings on the input space to orderings on the output space.  The problem is
that if any pair of output elements are associated with multiple input elements,
\begin{align*}
y_{1} &= f(x_1) = f(x_1')
\\
y_{2} &= f(x_2) = f(x_2'),
\end{align*}
then we can have conflicting input orderings,
\begin{align*}
x_1 &< x_2
\\
x_2' &< x_1',
\end{align*}
that cannot be combined into a consistent output ordering.

Ultimately injective functions define ordering pullbacks but only bijective
functions define ordering pushfowards and ordering pullbacks.

#### Relating Algebras

Algebraic structure is a bit more difficult to translate.  Consider, for
example, a binary algebraic operation that takes two elements from a set and
returns a single element.  In order to pushforward an operation on the input
space $\cdot$ we would need to map output elements to input elements,
apply the operation, and then map the result back to the output space,
$$
y_1 \; (f_{*} \cdot) \; y_2 \equiv f \left( f^{-1}(y_1) \cdot f^{-1}(y_2) \right).
$$
If $f$ is not bijective, however, then the inverses will be ill-defined.

Similarly in order to pullback an operation on the output space $\cdot$ we
would need to map input elements to output elements, apply the operation, and
then map the result back to the input space,
$$
x_1 \; (f^{*} \cdot) \; x_2 \equiv f^{-1} \left( f(x_1) \cdot f(y_2) \right).
$$
An injective function is sufficient for the first two steps to be well-defined,
but we still need $f$ to be bijective in order for the last step to also be
well-defined.

In other words we can pushforward and pullback binary algebraic operations only
when $f$ is a bijection.

#### Relating Metrics

Metrics are a bit more forgiving.  Applying $f : X \rightarrow Y$ to two input
elements defines two output elements that we can plug into a metric defined over
the output set,
$$
(f^{*} d)(x_1, x_2) \equiv d(f(x_1), f(x_2)).
$$
This composition, however, does not always define a proper metric over the input
set!  In particular if $f$ is not injective then $d(f(x_1), f(x_2))$ can
vanish even if $x_1 \ne x_2$.  Fortunately if $f$ is injective then
$(f^{*} d)(x_1, x_2)$ will satisfy all of the properties of a metric on the
input set in which case we denote it the **pullback metric**.

#### Relating Topologies

Finally let's consider how we might translate topologies across a function.
Using the map from input subsets to output subsets that we constructed above
we can map the collection of subsets that define a topology on the input set,
$$
\mathfrak{t} = \{ \mathsf{x}_{1}, \ldots, \mathsf{x}_{i}, \ldots \},
$$
into a collection of subsets in the output set,
$$
\{ f^{*}(\mathsf{x}_{1}), \ldots, f^{*}(\mathsf{x}_{i}), \ldots \}.
$$
This output collection, however, will not always satisfy the properties of a
topology.  For example if $f$ it not surjective then the output collection will
not contain the full set as needed.  Even if $f$ is surjective the pushforward
sets are not guaranteed to be closed under unions and intersections and hence
will not, in general, define a topology.

Fortunately pullbacks sets are a bit more well-behaved.  Pulling back the
subsets that define a topology on the output set,
$$
\mathfrak{t} = \{ \mathsf{y}_{1}, \ldots, \mathsf{y}_{i}, \ldots \},
$$
gives a collection of subsets on the input set,
$$
\{ f_{*}(\mathsf{y}_{1}), \ldots, f_{*}(\mathsf{y}_{i}), \ldots \}.
$$
When $f$ is surjective then this collection will include both
$f^{*}(\emptyset) = \emptyset$ and $f^{*}(Y) = X$.  Moreover these pullback
subsets are always closed under countable unions and finite intersections so
long as the input subsets are.  In other words if $f$ is surjective then
$$
f^{*} \mathfrak{t} \equiv
\{ f_{*}(\mathsf{y}_{1}), \ldots, f_{*}(\mathsf{y}_{i}), \ldots \}
$$
defines a **pullback topology** on $X$.

### Bijective Pushforwards and Pullbacks Relations

The asymmetry between the availability of pushforward and pullback actions for
different structures can be frustrating in practice, especially when an
application supplies structure on the wrong set.  Fortunately this asymmetry
washes away when we consider bijective functions and their inverses.

Consider for example some structure that only pulls back against a function,
$$
f^{*} : \mathfrak{Y} \rightarrow \mathfrak{X}.
$$
If $f$ is bijective then we can pullback that structure against the inverse
function,
$$
(f^{-1})^{*} : \mathfrak{X} \rightarrow \mathfrak{Y},
$$
which implicitly pushes forward structure defined on $X$ to structure defined on
$Y$.

Similarly if we have some structure that only pushes forward along a function,
$$
f_{*} : \mathfrak{X} \rightarrow \mathfrak{Y},
$$
then we can use the pushforward along the inverse function
$$
(f^{-1})_{*} : \mathfrak{Y} \rightarrow \mathfrak{X},
$$
to pullback structure defined on $Y$ to structure defined on $X$.

Importantly these induces transformations are also inverses,
\begin{align*}
f^{*} \circ (f^{-1})^{*} &= \mathrm{Id}_{\mathfrak{X}}
\\
(f^{-1})^{*} \circ f^{*} &= \mathrm{Id}_{\mathfrak{Y}}
\\
(f^{-1})_{*} \circ f_{*} &= \mathrm{Id}_{\mathfrak{X}}
\\
f_{*} \circ (f^{-1})_{*} &= \mathrm{Id}_{\mathfrak{Y}}.
\end{align*}
In other words bijective functions allow us to move back and forth between the
input space and the output space without losing information about the individual
element or any structure endowed to those elements.

### Structure-Preserving Relations

Pushforward and pullback functions allow us to _lift_ a transformation between
sets into a transformation between spaces.  For structure that can be pushed
forward along the function $f : X \rightarrow Y$ any input space
$(X, \mathfrak{x})$ automatically defines a compatible output space
$(Y, f_{*}(\mathfrak{x}))$.  Similarly for structure that can be pulled back
against $f$ any output space $(Y, \mathfrak{y})$ automatically defines a
compatible input space $(X, f^{*}(\mathfrak{y}))$.

Many applications, however, don't just define only an input space
$(X, \mathfrak{x})$ or only an output space $(Y, \mathfrak{y})$ but rather
_both_.  In this case pushforward structure may not be compatible with the
structure that has already been endowed on the output space,
$$
f_{*}(\mathfrak{x}) \ne \mathfrak{y},
$$
and pullback structure may not be compatible with the structure that has already
been endowed on the input space,
$$
f^{*}(\mathfrak{y}) \ne \mathfrak{x}.
$$
The exceptional functions that yield compatible pushforward and/or pullback
structure are known as **structure-preserving transformations**.
Structure-preserving bijections in particular are also known as **isomorphisms**.

#### Ordering-Preserving Relations

For example consider an ordered input space $(X, <_{X})$ and an ordered output
space $(Y, <_{Y})$.  For any function $f: X \rightarrow Y$ the pullback ordering
$f^{*} \!\! <_{Y}$ is defined by
$$
x_{1} \;\; f^{*}\!\!<_{Y} \; x_{2}
$$
if and only if
$$
f(x_{1}) <_{Y} f(x_{2}).
$$
There's no guarantee, however, that this will be consistent with the
pre-specified ordering $<_{X}$.  Instead we will have $f_{*} <_{Y} = <_{X}$ only
for the exceptional functions satisfying
$$
f(x_{1}) <_{Y} f(x_{2})
$$
if and only if
$$
x_{1} <_{X} x_{2}.
$$
These functions are known as **monotonically increasing functions**.  Functions
that respect given input and output partial orderings are known as
**monotonically non-decreasing functions**.

To demonstrate consider the functions
\begin{alignat*}{6}
f_1 :\; & \mathbb{R} & &\rightarrow& \; & \mathbb{R} &
\\
& x & &\mapsto& & x \cdot x \cdot x &
\end{alignat*}
and
\begin{alignat*}{6}
f_2 :\; & \mathbb{R} & &\rightarrow& \; & \mathbb{R} &
\\
& x & &\mapsto& & - x \cdot x \cdot x &
\end{alignat*}
that map between two distinct real lines with distinct orderings.  When
$x_{1} <_{X} x_{2}$ we have $f_1(x_{1}) <_{Y} f_1(x_{2})$ but
$f_2(x_{2}) <_{Y} f_2(x_{1})$ making the former monotonically increasing but the
latter not (@fig-monoticity).

::: {#fig-monoticity layout="[ [-5, 45, 45, -5] ]"}
![](figures/maps/monotonic/monotonic){#fig-monotonic}

![](figures/maps/non_monotonic/non_monotonic){#fig-non-monotonic}

Monotonically increasing functions preserve orderings so that larger inputs
always imply larger outputs. The function (a) $f_{1} : x \mapsto x^{3}$ is
monotonic but the function (b) $f_{1} : x \mapsto -x^{3}$ is not.
:::

#### Algebra-Preserving Relations

A bijective function that preserves algebraic structure is known as a
**homomorphism**.  Given two algebraic spaces equipped with binary algebraic
operations, $(X, \cdot_{X})$ and $(Y, \cdot_{Y})$, a function
$f : X \rightarrow Y$ is homomorphic if and only if
$$
f(x_{1} \cdot_{X} x_{2}) = f(x_{1}) \cdot_{Y} f(x_{2}).
$$

Consider for example the cubic function that maps a real line into another real
line,
\begin{alignat*}{6}
f :\; & \mathbb{R} & &\rightarrow& \; & \mathbb{R} &
\\
& x & &\mapsto& & x \cdot x \cdot x &.
\end{alignat*}
Because
$$
(x_1 + x_2)^3 \ne x_1^3 + x_2^3
$$,
where the $+$ on the left denotes addition on the input space and the $+$ on the
right denotes addition on the output space, $f$ is not a homomorphism for the
addition operation.  On the other hand because
$$
(x_1 \cdot x_2)^3 = x_1^3 \cdot x_2^3,
$$
where again $\cdot$ on the left and right actually denotes two distinct
multiplication operations, the function $f$ _is_ a homomorphism between for the
multiplication operation.

#### Metric-Preserving Relations

Injective transformations that preserve metric structure, and hence distances
between input and output elements
$$
d_X(x_1, x_2) = d_Y(f(x_1), f(x_2)),
$$
are known as **isometries**.  Non-isometric functions appear to _warp_ distances
relative to metric defined on the output space, and hence any grid that we might
use to visualize the input space.

For example the linear function
\begin{alignat*}{6}
f_1 :\; & \mathbb{R} & &\rightarrow& \; & \mathbb{R} &
\\
& x & &\mapsto& & x - \frac{1}{4} &
\end{alignat*}
is an isometry for the natural metric over the real line,
\begin{align*}
d_{Y}(f(x_1), f(x_2))
&=
\sqrt{ \big( f(x_{1}) - f(x_{2}) \big) \cdot \big( f(x_{1}) - f(x_{2}) \big) }
\\
&=
\sqrt{       \big( \big( x_{1} - \frac{1}{4} \big) - \big( x_{2} - \frac{1}{4} \big) \big)
       \cdot \big( \big( x_{1} - \frac{1}{4} \big) - \big( x_{2} - \frac{1}{4} \big) \big) }

\sqrt{ \big( x_{1} - x_{2} \big) \cdot \big( x_{1} - x_{2} \big) }

&=
d_{X}(x_1, x_2).
\end{align*}
One consequence of this isometry is that any grid of equally distant input
elements will map into a grid of equally distant output elements
(@fig-isometric).

On the other hand the bijective cubic function
\begin{alignat*}{6}
f_2 :\; & \mathbb{R} & &\rightarrow& \; & \mathbb{R} &
\\
& x & &\mapsto& & x \cdot x \cdot x &
\end{alignat*}
is not an isometry.  Instead the pushforward of the input metric defines
different distances than the output metric, resulting in a warped grids
(@fig-non-isometric).

Isometries preserve the metric structure of the input and output spaces,
ensuring that equally spaced input elements map into equally spaced output
elements.  When the input and output space are real lines (a) linear functions
define isometries and where as (b) nonlinear functions warp the input metric
relative to the output metric.

#### Topology-Preserving Relations

Bijections that respect any topological structure endowed to the input and
output sets are denoted **homeomorphisms** which, unfortunately, we have to
avoid confusing with algebra-preserving _homomorphisms_.  Etymologically
"homomorphism" is derived from the Greek for "same shape" while "homeomorphism"
is derived from the Greek for "similar shape" which have almost equivalent
meanings.  Contemporary mathematics, however, has adopted a convention where
the two terms are used exclusively to refer to algebraic and topological
structure, respectively.

More formally a bijective function is a homeomorphism if every subset in the
input topology pushes forward to a subset in the output topology and vice versa.
In other words neighborhoods are preserved and input elements near each other
are mapped into output elements that are also near each other, preserving the
continuity of the space.  Because of this homeomorphisms are also known as
invertible **continuous** functions.

In [Section 1.2.4.3](@sec:general-topology) we saw that lines and circles can be
constructed from a common set equipped with different topologies.  We can
construct bijections between the underlying set elements but any homeomorphism
will preserve the shape induced by the initial topology, mapping lines into
lines or circles into circles.  Only non-homeomorphic bijections are capable of
transforming the defining topologies, and hence a line into a circle or vice
versa (@fig-non-homeomorphism).

![A line and a circle can be build from a common set but require distinct
topologies to give them their characteristic shapes.  Because homeomorphisms
cannot modify these topologies they can map only lines into lines and circles
into circles but not lines into circles.  Any bijection from the elements that
comprise a line and the elements that comprise a circle cannot be homeomorphic.](

### Reparameterizations

The ambiguity in how we can interpret the integers and the real line as spaces
that we encountered in [Section 2](#sec:proto-spaces) also implies an ambiguity
in how we interpret transformation between them.

Considering for example if we take the perspective where there is not a single
real line but rather a collection of distinct real lines, each with their own
defining ordering, algebra, and metric.  In general a homeomorphism transforms
one of these real lines into another, and only the exceptional
monotonically-increasing, homomorphic, and isometric homeomorphisms will map one
of these real lines into itself.

Conversely we can treat the real line as a flexible space defined by a fixed
set and topology, with the different orderings, algebras, and metrics defining
different configurations of the real line.  From this perspective homeomorphisms
maintain the defining structure but generally transform the auxiliary structures.
This maps one configuration into another, effectively _reconfiguring_ the
flexible real line.  Because configurations are also known as parameterizations
the homeomorphic transformations are also known as **reparameterizations**.

While this interpretational ambiguity is often taken for granted it does
manifest in a variety of different applications.  For example in physics we can
interpret transformations of a physical system as _active_ or _passive_.  An
active transformation is interpreted as changing the physical system while a
passive transformation is interpreted as changing how we represent a fixed
physical system.  Both interpretations yield equivalent results, but one can be
more natural in some contexts than others.

A variable taking values on the real line can be used to quantify some property
of some physical system.  Transforming from one real line to another can be
interpreted as changing the actual quantification or equivalently as a change of
_units_ for a fixed quantification.

At the same time we find can find similar ambiguities in language.  We might
interpret text written in a particular language as fundamental in which case
_translations_ from one language to another map one text to another.  That said
we might also interpret these texts as _representations_ of some universal
statement in which case translations don't change the statement but do change
the representation.

Similarly we might have the freedom to interpret computer programs written in
different programming languages as either distinct programs or different
implementations of some fixed program with universal inputs and outputs.  In
the former interpretation _transpilers_ map from one program to another but in
the latter they map from one implementation to another.

Again these interpretations are equivalent, and we are free to adopt the one
that is most useful in any given application.  In this book I will embrace the
perspective where the real line is defined as a flexible space, with different
choices of ordering, algebraic, and metric structure defining different
parameterizations of that space.  This will have some subtle consequences going
forwards, but I will address those consequences as they arise.

# Conclusion

Spaces are one of those ubiquitous mathematical concepts that are often taken for
granted.  While this can be adequate for more heuristic mathematical modeling
tasks it does leave us open to some existential crises if we look a little bit
too closely and start asking, for example, what exactly a reparameterization is.

In this chapter we've surveyed the formal construction of spaces, from an
underlying set to the many structures that endow that set with useful
properties, and their transformations.  Along the way we took a careful look at
familiar concepts like variables while also digging into some more complicated
concepts like topology with an emphasis on appreciating how they can be useful
beyond just theoretical mathematics.  This understanding will provide a strong
foundation on which we introduce probability theory in its full generality, and
hence full power.

There are a wealth of resources for those interested in exploring these topics
more deeply, although finding the right resource is often a challenge.  Many of
the more accessible resources are prone to oversimplification which can make it
difficult to iterate to more technical resources.  At the same time the more
technical resources often jump directly into detail with little to no context
for why the details might be relevant.

Personally I have found John Lee's introductory writing to be a reasonable
middle ground, especially the appendices and first few chapters of @Lee:2011 as
well as the appendices to @Lee:2013.  Similarly I find that @Curtis:1993
provides an accessible introduction to the more technical aspects of linear
algebra.  An additional benefit of these resources is that they can help
acclimate one to the writing style particular to theoretical mathematics which
can make other resources a bit more accessible.

At the same time the articles on
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics) are continuously
improving.  I find these articles to be a particularly useful reference for
delving into technical details on precise topics.
