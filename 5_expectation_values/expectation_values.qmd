In [Chapter Four](https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/chapters_html/probability_on_general_spaces.html) we defined measures, and probability
distributions as a special case, as mappings from measurable subsets to
allocated measures.  These subset allocations, however, also induce a
somewhat surprising but incredibly powerful mapping from real-valued
functions to single real numbers that generalizes Riemann integration
from calculus.  This measure-informed integration operation summarizes
the interaction between a measure and a given function, allowing us to
use one to learn about the other.

We will begin our exploration of measure-informed integration with a
heuristic construction on finite measure spaces before considering a
more formal, but also more abstract, construction that applies to any
measure space.  Next we'll investigate how the specification of
measure-informed integrals can be used to implicitly define measures
without having to explicitly define subset allocations and some useful
applications of these implicit specifications.  Finally we'll consider
particular measure-informed integrals that are distinguished by common
ambient space structures and then conclude with a discussion of a few
exceptional measures whose integrals can be computed algorithmically.

# Integration on Finite Measure Spaces {#sec:finite_integration}

To start our discussion of measure-informed integration as simply as
possible let's begin by considering a finite measure space comprised
of the finite set
$$
X = \{ \Box, \clubsuit, \diamondsuit, \heartsuit, \spadesuit \},
$$
a measure defined by the mass function
$$
\mu : X \rightarrow [0, \infty],
$$
and a real-valued function $f : X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$.

The allocations defined by the mass function weight the elements of $X$
relative to each other, emphasizing some while suppressing others.  At
the same time the function $f$ associates those elements with a
numerical output.  We can then weight the numerical outputs by combining
the weights of the inputs $\mu(x)$ and the individual output values
$f(x)$,
$$
\mu(x) \cdot f(x).
$$

Adding all of these weighted outputs together gives a single number that
is sensitive to the interplay between $\mu$ and $f$,
\begin{align*}
\sum_{x \in X} \mu(x) \cdot f(x)
&=
\quad \mu(\Box) \cdot f(\Box)
\\
&\quad
+ \mu(\clubsuit) \cdot f(\clubsuit)
\\
&\quad
+ \mu(\diamondsuit) \cdot f(\diamondsuit)
\\
&\quad
+ \mu(\heartsuit) \cdot f(\heartsuit)
\\
&\quad
+ \mu(\spadesuit) \cdot f(\spadesuit).
\end{align*}
This summary emphasizes not only large output values but also outputs
from highly-weighted inputs.  For example even if the output $f(\Box)$
is small the contribution from $\Box$ can still be important if the
atomic allocation $\mu(\Box)$ is large.

This summary defines the **integral** of $f$ with respect to $\mu$,
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{I}_{\mu}[f]
&\equiv \sum_{x \in X} \mu(x) \cdot f(x).
\end{align*}
We use square brackets instead of round brackets to visually denote that
the mapping doesn't take points as input but rather entire functions.

An interesting side effect of this construction is that measure-informed
integrals are linear: given two real-valued functions
$f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and $g : X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and two
real constants $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{R}$ we have
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{I}_{\mu}[\alpha \cdot f + \beta \cdot g]
&= \sum_{x \in X} \mu(x) \cdot
\left[ \alpha \cdot f(x) + \beta \cdot g(x) \right]
\\
&=  \sum_{x \in X} \mu(x) \cdot
\left( \alpha \cdot f(x) + \beta \cdot g(x) \right)
\\
&=  \alpha \cdot \sum_{x \in X} \mu(x) \cdot f(x)
  + \beta \cdot \sum_{x \in X} \mu(x) \cdot g(x)
\\
&=  \alpha \cdot \mathbb{I}_{\mu}[f]
  + \beta \cdot \mathbb{I}_{\mu}[g].
\end{align*}
We will exploit this linearity property _endlessly_ when working with
measure-informed integrals.

The measure-informed integral $\mathbb{I}_{\mu}[f]$ is sensitive to the
behavior of $f$, but only in the context of $\mu$.  By considering
multiple _test_ measures, however, we can use this operation to more
fully probe the behavior of a fixed function $f$.  Measure-informed
integrals of $f$ with respect to test measures that emphasizes certain
input elements will be more sensitive to the corresponding output
elements, probing different aspects of $f$.  More intuitively we can
interpret each test measure $\mu_{j}$ as encoding a question about $f$
and the corresponding measure-informed integral
$\mathbb{I}_{\mu_{j}}[f]$ as encoding the answer
(@fig-probing-functions).

![](figures/probing_measures/probing_measures){#fig-probing-measures}

Measure-informed integrals probe the interaction between a measure and a
real-valued function.  (a) If we fix the function $f$ then
measure-informed integrals with respect to multiple test measures are
sensitive to different features of $f$.  We can interpret each test
measure as a question about $f$ with the corresponding measure-informed
integral providing an answer.  (b)  Similarly measure-informed integrals
of multiple test functions with respect to a fixed measure $\mu$ are
sensitive to different features of $\mu$.  Again we can interpret each
test function as a question about $\mu$ with the corresponding
measure-informed integral encoding an answer.
:::

For example consider a _singular_ probability mass function that
concentrates entirely on a single element,
$$
\delta_{x'} (x) =
\left\{
\begin{array}{rr}
1, & x = x' \\
0, & x \neq x'
\end{array}
\right. .
$$
The measure-informed integrals of any real-valued function $f$ with
respect to $\delta_{x_{i}}$ are given by
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{I}_{\delta_{x'}}[f]
&= \sum_{x \in X} \delta_{x'}(x) \cdot f(x)
\\
&= \delta_{x'}(x') \cdot f(x')
  + \sum_{x \neq x'} \delta_{x'}(x) \cdot f(x)
\\
&=  1 \cdot f(x')
  + \sum_{x \neq x'} 0 \cdot f(x)
\\
&= f(x').
\end{align*}
In other words measure-informed integration of functions with respect to
$\delta_{x'}$ allow us to probe the individual output values $f(x')$.

Similarly consider a uniform probability mass function where each
element is allocated the same probability,
$$
\pi(x) = \frac{1}{I}.
$$
The corresponding measure-informed integrals captures the **average** of
the function output values,
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{I}_{\pi}[f]
&= \sum_{x \in X} \pi(x) \cdot f(x)
\\
&= \sum_{x \in X} \frac{1}{I} \cdot f(x)
\\
&= \frac{1}{I} \sum_{x \in X} f(x).
\end{align*}
When we use non-uniform measures this measure-informed integration
generalizes averages to more general summaries.

At the same time we can use different test functions to probe different
features of a fixed measure $\mu$.  Measure-informed integrals of test
functions with larger outputs for some inputs will be more sensitive to
the measures $\mu$ allocated to those inputs.  Again we can interpret
each test function $f_{j}$ as encoding a different question about $\mu$
with the corresponding measure-informed integrals
$\mathbb{I}_{\mu}[f_{j}]$ encoding the answer (@fig-probing-measures).

For example for any subset $\mathsf{x} \subset X$ we can construct an
**indicator function** that returns $1$ if the input is contained in
$\mathsf{x}$ and zero otherwise,
$$
I_{\mathsf{x}} (x) =
\left\{
\begin{array}{rr}
1, & x \in \mathsf{x} \\
0, & x \notin \mathsf{x}
\end{array}
\right. .
$$
In other words an indicator function _indicates_ whether or not a point
is contained in the defining subset.

The measure-informed integral of the indicator function
$I_{\mathsf{x}}$, however, is just the measure allocated to
$\mathsf{x}$,
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{I}_{\mu}[I_{\mathsf{x}}]
&= \sum_{x \in X} \mu(x) \cdot I_{\mathsf{x}} (x)
\\
&= \sum_{x \in \mathsf{x}} \mu(x) \cdot I_{\mathsf{x}} (x)
  + \sum_{x \notin \mathsf{x}} \mu(x) \cdot I_{\mathsf{x}} (x)
\\
&=  \sum_{x \in \mathsf{x}} \mu(x) \cdot 1
  + \sum_{x \notin \mathsf{x}} \mu(x) \cdot 0
\\
&=  \sum_{x \in \mathsf{x}} \mu(x)
\\
&= \mu( \mathsf{x} ).
\end{align*}
Measure-informed integrals of various indicator functions allow us to
directly probe the various subset allocations.

# Integration on General Measure Spaces

Unfortunately the straightforward construction of measure-informed
integrals on finite spaces doesn't generalize to general measure spaces.
In particular on uncountable spaces, where element-wise allocations
$\mu( \{x\} )$ do not completely characterize a measure, the weighted
output values $\mu( \{ x \} ) \cdot f(x)$ do not completely characterize
the interaction between a measure and a real-valued function.

In order to generalize measure-informed integrals to arbitrary measure
spaces we have to appeal to a more sophisticated construction with some
subtle, but important, consequences.

## Integration of Simple Functions

We'll build up to general measure-informed integrals by considering
increasingly sophisticated classes of functions that are still nice
enough for their measure-informed integrals to be unambiguous on any
measurable space.

For example consider indicator functions which vanish outside of a given
measurable subset (@fig-indicator)
$$
I_{\mathsf{x}} (x) =
\left\{
\begin{array}{rr}
1, & x \in \mathsf{x} \\
0, & x \notin \mathsf{x}
\end{array}
\right. .
$$

![An indicator function corresponding to a measurable subset
$\mathsf{x} \in \mathcal{X}$ vanishes for all inputs that are not
contained in $\mathsf{x}$.  Here $\mathsf{x}$ is an interval subset
over a real line.](
figures/indicator_function/indicator_function){
width=60% #fig-indicator}

In order to generalize the behavior on finite measure spaces that we
encountered in [Section One](@sec:finite_integration) the
measure-informed integral of any indicator function should be equal to
the measure allocated to that subset,
$$
\mathbb{I}_{\mu}[ I_{\mathsf{x}} ]
=
\mu( \mathsf{x} ),
$$
for any measure $\mu$.

We can manufacture even more complex functional behavior by overlaying
multiple indicator functions on top of each other.  A
**simple function** is given by the sum of scaled indicator functions
(@fig-simple),
$$
s(x) = \sum_{j} \phi_{j} \cdot I_{\mathsf{x}_{j}}(x),
$$
where
$$
\{ \mathsf{x}_{1}, \ldots, \mathsf{x}_{j}, \ldots \} \in \mathcal{X}
$$
is any sequence of measurable subsets and
$$
\{ \phi_{1}, \ldots, \phi_{j}, \ldots \} \in \mathbb{R}
$$
is any sequence of real numbers.  By incorporating countably many
indicator functions we can engineer quite sophisticated functional
behavior.

![Simple functions are constructed from linear combinations of indicator
functions.  Incorporating more indicator functions yields more
sophisticated functional behavior.](
figures/simple_function/simple_function){
width=90% #fig-simple}

If we assume that measure-informed integration is a linear operation on
any measure space then we can immediately compute the integral of any
simple function,
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{I}_{\mu}[ s ]
&=
\mathbb{I}_{\mu} \left[ \sum_{j} \phi_{j} \cdot I_{\mathsf{x}_{j}} \right]
\\
&=
\sum_{j} \phi_{j} \cdot \mathbb{I}_{\mu}[ I_{\mathsf{x}_{j}} ]
\\
&=
\sum_{j} \phi_{j} \cdot \mu(\mathsf{x}_{j}).
\end{align*}

## Integration of Measurable Functions

Most functions whose measure-informed integrals are of interest in
practical analysis are not simple functions.  Relevant functions,
however, can often be _well-approximated_ by simple functions.  As we
incorporate more and more indicator functions we can construct simple
functions that approximate non-simple functions better and better
(@fig-simple-approx).

![As we incorporate more indicator functions simple functions become
more flexible and are able to better approximate the behavior of
non-simple functions.  Certain non-negative functions can be _exactly_
recovered from sufficiently flexible simple functions.](
figures/simple_function_approx/simple_function_approx){
width=90% #fig-simple-approx}

Some functions can even be _exactly_ recovered from sufficiently
flexible simple functions.  A real-valued function
$f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is **measurable** with respect to the
$\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{X}$, or **$\mathcal{X}$-measurable**, if
every half-interval of outputs
$$
(-\infty, x] \subset \mathbb{R}
$$
pulls back to a measurable subset on $(X, \mathcal{X})$,
$$
f^{*}( (-\infty, x] )
=
\{ x \in X \mid f(x) \in (\infty, x] \}
\in \mathcal{X}.
$$
In practice non-measurable functions are as difficult to construct as
non-measurable subsets and measurability can largely be taken for
granted.  

We'll come back to the topic of measurable functions in much more detail 
in Chapter Seven.  For now our main concern will be to avoid confusing 
measurable _subsets_ on $(X, \mathcal{X})$ and measurable _functions_ 
from $(X, \mathcal{X})$ to $\mathbb{R}$.

Measurable functions with non-negative outputs,
$$
f(x) \ge 0
$$
for all $x \in X$, are particularly special.  Any non-negative,
measurable function can always be _perfectly_ recovered as a certain
limit of increasingly complicated simple functions,
$$
f(x) = \sum_{j = 1}^{\infty} \phi_{j} \cdot I_{\mathsf{x}_{j}}(x).
$$
We can then _define_ the measure-informed integral of a non-negative,
measurable function as the measure-informed integral of the
corresponding simple function decomposition,
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{I}_{\mu}[f]
&\equiv
\mathbb{I}_{\mu} \left[
\sum_{j = 1}^{\infty} \phi_{j} \cdot I_{\mathsf{x}_{j}} \right]
\\
&=
\sum_{j = 1}^{\infty} \phi_{j} \cdot
\mathbb{I}_{\mu} \left[I_{\mathsf{x}_{j}} \right]
\\
&=
\sum_{j = 1}^{\infty} \phi_{j} \cdot
\mu(\mathsf{x}_{j}).
\end{align*}

In general a non-negative, measurable function can be represented by
more than one simple function decomposition.  Fortunately the
measure-informed integral derived from any of them will always be the
same.  Consequently there's no worry for ambiguous or otherwise
inconsistent answers, and measure-informed integrals for non-negative,
measurable functions are completely well-behaved.

This procedure for defining measure-informed integrals through simple
functions representations is known as **Lebesgue integration** in the
mathematics literature.  In this book I will use the more explicit
"measure-informed integration" instead.

We've come a long way, but non-negative functions are still somewhat
exceptional amongst all of the functions that might come up in a given
analysis.  To define measure-informed integrals for measurable functions
that aren't necessarily positive we just have to decompose the functions
by the sign of their outputs (@fig-sign-decomposition),
$$
f(x) = f^{+}(x) - f^{-}(x),
$$
where
$$
f^{+} (x) =
\left\{
\begin{array}{rr}
f(x), & f(x) \ge 0 \\
0, & f(x) < 0
\end{array}
\right.
$$
and
$$
f^{-} (x) =
\left\{
\begin{array}{rr}
- f(x), & f(x) < 0 \\
0, & f(x) \ge 0
\end{array}
\right. .
$$

![Every real-valued function $f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ function can
be decomposed by the sign of its output values, resulting in the two
positive functions $f^{+}: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{+}$ and
$f^{-}: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{+}$.](
figures/sign_decomposition/sign_decomposition){
width=90% #fig-sign-decomposition}

Because $f^{+}$ and $f^{-}$ are both non-negative we can construct
their measure-informed integrals $\mathbb{I}_{\mu}[f^{+}]$ and
$\mathbb{I}_{\mu}[f^{-}]$ as above.  Provided that the measure-informed
integrals are not both infinite we can then define the measure-informed
integral of $f$ by taking advantage of linearity,
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{I}_{\mu}[f]
=
\mathbb{I}_{\mu}[f^{+} - f^{-}]
=
\mathbb{I}_{\mu}[f^{+}] - \mathbb{I}_{\mu}[f^{-}].
\end{align*}

One way to ensure that this difference is well-defined is to require
that
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{I}_{\mu}[ \, | f | \, ]
=
\mathbb{I}_{\mu}[f^{+} + f^{-}]
=
\mathbb{I}_{\mu}[f^{+}] + \mathbb{I}_{\mu}[f^{-}]
\end{align*}
is finite.  Measurable functions $f : X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$
with
$$
\mathbb{I}_{\mu}[| f |] < \infty
$$
are said to be **Lebesgue integrable** with respect to $\mu$, or just
**$\mu$-integrable** for short.

I will refer to any real-valued function $f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$
that is measurable with respect to the ambient $\sigma$-algebra and
integrable with respect to any relevant measures simply as an
**integrand**.

Nearly every real-valued function that we will encounter in practical
applications will be measurable. Consequently taking this technical
assumption for granted is largely safe.  Many real-valued functions will
also be integrable with respect to typical measures, especially when we
restrict attention to probability distributions.  That said there are
enough exceptions that we have to be careful to explicitly validate
integrability in practice.

## Equivalent Integrands

One subtle but important consequence of this general definition of
measure-informed integration is that many integrands will yield the same
measure-informed integrals even when their individual outputs are not
all equal!

To see why let's consider a simple function
$s: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ that's build up from arbitrarily many
indicator functions,
$$
s(x) = \sum_{j} \phi_{j} \cdot I_{\mathsf{x}_{j}}(x).
$$
Adding another indicator function with respect to the measurable subset
$\mathsf{x}'$ gives another simple function,
$$
s'(x) = s(x) + \phi' \cdot I_{\mathsf{x}'}(x).
$$
The measure-informed integrals of these two simple functions are then
related to each other by
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{I}_{\mu}[s']
&=
\mathbb{I}_{\mu}[s + \phi' \cdot I_{\mathsf{x}'}]
\\
&=
\mathbb{I}_{\mu}[s] + \phi' \cdot \mathbb{I}_{\mu}[I_{\mathsf{x}'}]
\\
&=
\mathbb{I}_{\mu}[s] + \phi' \cdot \mu(\mathsf{x}').
\end{align*}

When $\phi' \ne 0$ then $s(x)$ and $s'(x)$ will differ for all
$x \in \mathsf{x}'$; so long as $\mathsf{x}'$ is not the empty set then
the function outputs will differ for at least some inputs.  On the other
hand the corresponding measure-informed integrals will differ only if
$$
\mu(\mathsf{x}') > 0!
$$
In other words if $\mathsf{x}'$ is a $\mu$-null subset then $s$ and $s'$
will share the exact same $\mu$-integrals.

More generally any two integrands $f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and
$g: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ will share the same $\mu$-integrals if the
subset of input points where their outputs differ,
$$
\mathsf{x}_{\delta} = \{ x \in X \mid f(x) \ne g(x) \},
$$
is a subset of $\mu$-null subset,
$$
\mathsf{x}_{\delta} \subseteq \mathsf{x} \in \mathcal{X}
$$
with
$$
\mu(\mathsf{x}) = 0.
$$
Intuitively modifying integrands on sets of measure zero does not affect
their measure-informed integrals.

If the subset of deviant inputs is contained within a $\mu$-null subset
then $f$ and $g$ are said to be equal **almost everywhere** with respect
to $\mu$.  When working with probability distributions instead of
measures the term **almost surely** equal is used instead.  A bit more
colloquially we can say that the two integrands are equal **up to subsets
of measure zero** or equal **up to null subsets**.

Much of the mathematics literature overloads the equals sign when
referring to measurable functions that are equal almost everywhere in
equations, as that is the only notion of equals that is relevant in
measure and probability theory.  In this book I will be more explicit
and use
$$
f \overset{\mu}{=} g
$$
whenever comparing two measurable functions that are equal up to
$\mu$-null subsets.

Intuitively the null subsets of a measure can "wash out" some of the
finer structure of integrands.  For example on a real line any countable
collection of points is allocated zero Lebesgue measure.  Consequently
integration with respect to the Lebesgue measure will disregard any
"point defects" in the integrals (@fig-equivalent-integrands).

![Because any countable collection of points is allocated zero Lebesgue
measure any integrands whose outputs differ only at a countable number
of inputs will yield the same measure-informed integrals.  Here
$\mathbb{I}_{\lambda}[f_{1}] = \mathbb{I}_{\lambda}[f_{2}] = \mathbb{I}_{\lambda}[f_{3}]$
and, from perspective of the Lebesgue measure, these functions are
equivalent.  In this case we write
$f_{1} \overset{\lambda}{=} f_{2} \overset{\lambda}{=} f_{3}$.](
figures/equivalent_integrands/equivalent_integrands){
width=90% #fig-equivalent-integrands}

Applications of measure theory can't distinguish between integrands that
are equal up to sets of measure zero.  If we want to avoid this
ambiguity then we have to impose structural constraints to isolate a
single, unique integrands from the collection of equivalent integrands.
For example we can modify a continuous integrands on input subsets of
measure zero without changing the measure-informed integrals, but those
modifications will also introduce discontinuities.  Amongst all of the
equivalent integrands only one will be continuous and even though
general integrands are not unique continuous integrands are.

Equality up to sets of measure zero is mostly a technical concern, but
there are few exceptional circumstances where it will be relevant in
practice.  I will clearly point these circumstances out as we go along.

## Alternative Measure-Informed Integral Notations { #sec:alt_notations }

One of the limitations of the measure-informed integral notation,
$\mathbb{I}_{\mu}[f]$, is that it doesn't denote the ambient space.
When working on a single space this isn't too much of an issue, but it
can cause confusion when we start working with multiple spaces at the
same time.

A more expressive notation like
$$
\mathbb{I}_{(X, \mathcal{X}, \mu)}[f]
\\
\mathbb{I}_{(Y, \mathcal{Y}, \nu)}[g]
$$
is much more explicit but also much more cumbersome.  Mathematicians
have developed a variety of shorthand notations that offer different
compromises between clarity and compactness.

For example some references denote measure-informed integrals as
$$
\mathbb{I}_{\mu}[f] = \int_{X} \mu \, f,
$$
where the subscript of the integral sign allows us to specify the
ambient space and a $\sigma$-algebra is taken for granted.  When using
this notation, however, we have to be careful to not confuse $\int$ with
the Riemann integral from calculus.  We'll discuss the subtle
relationship between measure-informed integration and Riemann
integration in detail in [Section 5.2](@sec:integration_on_R).

We can also use variables to denote the ambient space.  Taking $x \in X$
to be a variable that takes values in $X$, some references denote
measure-informed integrals as
$$
\mathbb{I}_{\mu}[f] = \int \mu(\mathrm{d} x) \, f(x),
$$
or
$$
\mathbb{I}_{\mu}[f] = \int \mathrm{d} \mu(x) \, f(x).
$$
The placement of the measure and the integrand is conventional; some
references prefer instead
$$
\mathbb{I}_{\mu}[f] = \int f(x) \, \mu(\mathrm{d} x),
$$
and
$$
\mathbb{I}_{\mu}[f] = \int f(x) \, \mathrm{d} \mu(x).
$$
Again when using these particular notations we have to be careful to
avoid confusing them with Riemann integrals.

For this book I will use $\mathbb{I}_{\mu}[f]$ most often, but when
it becomes convenient I'll also use the notation
$$
\mathbb{I}_{\mu}[f] = \int \mu(\mathrm{d} x) \, f(x).
$$

## Expectation Values

In this book we will ultimately be interested in not general measures
but rather probability distributions.  General measures will be used
only as tools to help implement probability distributions in practice.

Within this context measure-informed integration is also known as
**expectation**, with measure-informed integrals known as
**expectation values**, $\mathbb{E}_{\pi}[f]$.  Similarly integrands
become **expectands**.

Technically either terminology is correct when referring to probability
distributions, but I will use the expectation terminology as much as
possible to better relate to the statistics literature where it is
typical.

# Specifying Measures With Integrals

To this point we have derived measure-informed integrals as a
consequence of measurable subset allocations.  Measure-informed
integrals, however, can also be used to define measures directly, with
subset allocations derived indirectly.  While a bit more abstract than
our initial approach this perspective does have its benefits.

## Functional Perspective of Measures

Measure-informed integrals map real-valued functions into real numbers.
If we denote the space of all functions from $X$ to $\mathbb{R}$ as
$C(X)$ then we might be tempted to write this mapping as
\begin{alignat*}{6}
\mathbb{I}_{\mu} :\; & C(X) & &\rightarrow& \; & \mathbb{R} &
\\
& f & &\mapsto& & \mathbb{I}_{\mu}[f] &.
\end{alignat*}
Unfortunately this isn't technically correct because not every
real-valued function has a well-defined measure-informed integral.  In
other words $C(X)$ is too large of an input space.

To remedy that we can define
$$
L(X, \mathcal{X}, \mu) \subset C(X)
$$
as the subset of real-valued functions from $X$ to $\mathbb{R}$ that
are measurable with respect to $\mathcal{X}$ and then integrable with
respect to $\mu$.  Using the terminology introduced in the previous
section, $L(X, \mathcal{X}, \mu)$ is the space of integrands.

With this notation measure-informed integration can be interpreted as a
map from integrands to real numbers,
\begin{alignat*}{6}
\mathbb{I}_{\mu} :\; & L(X, \mathcal{X}, \mu) & &\rightarrow& \;
& \mathbb{R} &
\\
& f & &\mapsto& & \mathbb{I}_{\mu}[f] &.
\end{alignat*}
In fact measure-informed integration is the only _linear_ mapping of
this form.

Because $L(X, \mathcal{X}, \mu)$ contains all of the indicator functions
this functional relationship between $L(X, \mathcal{X}, \mu)$ and
$\mathbb{R}$ determines the allocations to every measurable subset,
and hence fully determines the measure $\mu$.  At the same time
$L(X, \mathcal{X}, \mu)$ also contains many integrands that are not
indicator functions, and hence quite a bit of redundant information
about $\mu$.

Sufficiently nice measures can be completely characterized by their
integral action on subsets of $L(X, \mathcal{X}, \mu)$ that do not
contain any indicator functions at all!  In theory the measure-informed
integrals of other integrands, including indicator functions to recover
subset allocations, can then be derived from these initial integrals.
These sparser characterizations are particularly useful for analyzing
certain theoretical properties of measures with the tools of
**functional analysis**.

The integration perspective also has its benefits for applied practice.
For example once we've built a probability distribution relevant to an
application we will use expectation values to extract meaningful
information.  **Probabilistic computational algorithms** automate this
process, mapping expectands to expectation values exactly or, more
realistically, approximately.

Interpreting measures as integral generators helps us understand not
only what operations we need to carry out to realize an applied analysis
but also how well our algorithmic tools actually implement those
operations.  We will spend a good bit of time discussing these issues in
later chapters.

## Scaling Measures { #sec:scaling_measures }

Measures become much more flexible tools when we can readily modify
their behavior, enhancing the measure at some points while suppressing
it at others.  The functional perspective of measures is particularly
convenient for implicitly defining these modifications that would be
at best awkward to specify directly through subset allocations.

For example let's say that we want to _globally_ scale the subset
allocations defined by $\mu$ with a constant
$\alpha \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$.  The scaled measure is straightforward to
define by modifying the individual subset allocations,
$$
(\alpha \cdot \mu)(\mathsf{x}) \equiv \alpha \cdot \mu(\mathsf{x})
$$
for all measurable subsets $\mathsf{x} \in \mathcal{X}$.

These scaled allocations then imply that measure-informed integrals of
simple functions with respect to $\alpha \cdot \mu$ can be recovered as
measure-informed integrals of _scaled_ integrands with respect to $\mu$,
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{I}_{\alpha \cdot \mu} [ s ]
&=
\mathbb{I}_{\alpha \cdot \mu}
\left[ \sum_{j} \phi_{j} \cdot I_{\mathsf{x}_{j}} \right]
\\
&=
\sum_{j} \phi_{j} \cdot
\mathbb{I}_{\alpha \cdot \mu} [ I_{\mathsf{x}_{j}} ]
\\
&=
\sum_{j} \phi_{j} \cdot (\alpha \cdot \mu)(\mathsf{x}_{j})
\\
&=
\sum_{j} \phi_{j} \cdot \alpha \cdot \mu(\mathsf{x}_{j})
\\
&=
\alpha \cdot \sum_{j} \phi_{j} \cdot \mu(\mathsf{x}_{j})
\\
&=
\alpha \cdot \sum_{j} \phi_{j} \cdot
\mathbb{I}_{\mu}
[ I_{\mathsf{x}_{j}} ]
\\
&=
\mathbb{I}_{\mu}
\left[ \alpha \cdot \sum_{j} \phi_{j} \cdot I_{\mathsf{x}_{j}} \right]
\\
&=
\mathbb{I}_{\mu} [ \alpha \cdot s ].
\end{align*}
Because general measure-informed integrals are derived from the
measure-informed integrals of simple functions we will then have
$$
\mathbb{I}_{\alpha \cdot \mu} [ f ] = \mathbb{I}_{\mu} [ \alpha \cdot f ]
$$
for _every_ integrand $f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$.  In other words
these modified integrals fully define the scaled measure
$\alpha \cdot \mu$ just as well as the modified subset allocations.

To complicate matters we might then ask how we can _locally_ scale a
measure by some positive, $\mathcal{X}$-measurable, real-valued function
$g: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{+}$.  Because $g$ varies across non-atomic
subsets it is no longer clear how we can consistently modify all of the
initial subset allocations to be larger when $g$ is larger and smaller
when $g$ is smaller.

The functional construction, however, immediately generalizes.  We can
_define_ a scaled measure $g \cdot \mu$ as the unique measure with the
integrals
$$
\mathbb{I}_{g \cdot \mu} [ f ] \equiv \mathbb{I}_{\mu} [ g \cdot f ]
$$
for every integrand $f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with
$$
\mathbb{I}_{\mu} [ \, | g \cdot f | \, ] < \infty.
$$

This integral definition can then be used to calculate the subtle, but
necessary, modifications to the subset allocations,
\begin{align*}
(g \cdot \mu)(\mathsf{x})
&=
\mathbb{I}_{g \cdot \mu} [ I_{\mathsf{x}} ]
\\
&=
\mathbb{I}_{\mu} [ g \cdot I_{\mathsf{x}} ].
\end{align*}
In particular the modified subset allocations are no longer given by
simple scalings of the initial subset allocations!

This flexible construction can be applied in a variety of useful ways.
For example scaling a measure $\mu$ by the indicator function of a
measurable subset $\mathsf{x}'$,
$$
\mathbb{I}_{I_{\mathsf{x}'} \cdot \mu} [ f ]
\equiv
\mathbb{I}_{\mu} [ I_{\mathsf{x}'} \cdot f ],
$$
consistently zeroes out all measure outside of $\mathsf{x}'$,
restricting $\mu$ to that subset.  If $X$ is an ordered space and
$\mathsf{x}'$ is an interval subset then this restriction is also known
as **truncation**.

## Scaling Probability Distributions

Scaling probability distributions is not quite as straightforward
because we have to maintain the proper normalization.  Naively scaling a
probability distribution $\pi$ with a positive,
$\mathcal{X}$-measurable, real-valued function
$g : X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{+}$ results in a total measure
\begin{align*}
(g \cdot \pi)(X)
&=
\mathbb{I}_{g \cdot \pi} [ I_{X} ]
\\
&=
\mathbb{I}_{g \cdot \pi} [ 1 ]
\\
&=
\mathbb{E}_{\pi} [ g ]
\end{align*}
which is not, in general, equal to $1$.  In other words scaling a
probability distribution results not in another probability distribution
but rather a generic measure.

If we want to transform one probability distribution into another then we
need to correct for the modified normalization, defining
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}_{g \ast \pi} [ f ]
&\equiv
\mathbb{E}_{\pi} \left[ \frac{g}{ \mathbb{E}_{\pi} [ g ] } \cdot f \right]
\\
&=
\frac{ \mathbb{E}_{\pi} [ g \cdot f ] }{ \mathbb{E}_{\pi} [ g ] }
\end{align*}
for every expectand $f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with
$$
\mathbb{E}_{\pi} [ \, | g \cdot f | \, ] < \infty.
$$

In this case the modified subset allocations become
\begin{align*}
(g \ast \pi)(\mathsf{x})
&=
\frac{ \mathbb{E}_{\pi} [ g \cdot I_{\mathsf{x}} ] }
{ \mathbb{E}_{\pi} [ g ] }.
\end{align*}
Specifically we will always have
\begin{align*}
(g \ast \pi)(X)
&=
\frac{ \mathbb{E}_{\pi} [ g \cdot I_{X} ] }
{ \mathbb{E}_{\pi} [ g ] }
\\
&=
\frac{ \mathbb{E}_{\pi} [ g ] }
{ \mathbb{E}_{\pi} [ g ] }
\\
&=
1
\end{align*}
as necessary.

For example scaling with an indicator function restricts a probability
distribution to the corresponding subset and reduces the total
probability to the probability initially allocated to that subset,
\begin{align*}
(I_{\mathsf{x}'} \cdot \pi)(X)
&=
\mathbb{I}_{I_{\mathsf{x}'} \cdot \pi} [ I_{X} ]
\\
&=
\mathbb{I}_{I_{\mathsf{x}'} \cdot \pi} [ 1 ]
\\
&=
\mathbb{I}_{\pi} [ I_{\mathsf{x}'} ]
\\
&=
\pi(\mathsf{x}').
\end{align*}

Scaling and then normalizing, however, corrects the proportional
subset allocations to this restriction,
\begin{align*}
(I_{\mathsf{x}'} \ast \pi)( \mathsf{x} )
&=
\frac{ \mathbb{E}_{I_{\mathsf{x}'} \ast \pi} [ I_{\mathsf{x}} ] }
{ \mathbb{E}_{\pi} [ I_{\mathsf{x}'} ] }
\\
&=
\frac{ \mathbb{E}_{\pi} [ I_{\mathsf{x}'} \cdot I_{\mathsf{x}} ] }
{ \mathbb{E}_{\pi} [ I_{\mathsf{x}'} ] }
\\
&=
\frac{ \mathbb{E}_{\pi} [ I_{\mathsf{x}' \cap \mathsf{x}} ] }
{ \mathbb{E}_{\pi} [ I_{\mathsf{x}'} ] }
\\
&=
\frac{ \pi(\mathsf{x}' \cap \mathsf{x}) }
{ \pi(\mathsf{x}') }.
\end{align*}
In particular
$$
(I_{\mathsf{x}'} \ast \pi)( X )
=
\frac{ \pi(\mathsf{x}' \cap X) }{ \pi(\mathsf{x}') }
=
\frac{ \pi(\mathsf{x}') }{ \pi(\mathsf{x}') }
=
1.
$$

# Structure-Informed Integrals

Every ambient space admits infinitely many real-valued functions, and
hence endless ways to interrogate a given measure through
measure-informed integration.  Some integrands, however, are naturally
compatible with the structure of the space itself, and their integrals
extract particularly interpretable information.  In this section we'll
review some of the most common structure-informed integrals.

## Moments and Cumulants

Some spaces are inherently related to a real line.  The precise
relationship between the elements of a space and the elements of a real
line defines a distinguished real-valued function, and hence a
distinguished integrand.  We can even build off of this initial
integrand to construct an entire family of useful integrands.

### Embeddings

In order for an ambient space $X$ to be compatible with a real line it
needs to share the metric structure of the real line.  We say that we
can **embed** a metric space $X$ into a real line if we can construct an
isometric injection $\iota : X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, in other words a
function that maps each element of $X$ to a distinct output while also
preserving distances,
$$
d_{X}(x_{1}, x_{2})
= d_{\mathbb{R}}(\iota(x_{1}), \iota(x_{2}))
= | \iota(x_{2}) - \iota(x_{1}) |.
$$
Embedding maps are often denoted with a hooked arrow instead of the
typical flat arrow,
$$
\iota : X \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R},
$$
to communicate that some structure is being preserved by definition.

Note that the construction of an embedding requires that we fix the
output structure of the output real line, specifying either a particular
rigid real line or a particular parameterization of a flexible real
line.  An ambient might embed into _a_ real line, but it cannot embed
into _all_ real lines at the same time.

For example if $X$ is itself a real line then the identify map defines a
natural embedding $\iota : \mathbb{R} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}$
(@fig-identity).  Similarly we can embed subsets of a real line, such
as intervals $\iota : [x_{1}, x_{2}] \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}$
(@fig-interval) or even integers
$\iota : \mathbb{Z} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ (@fig-integer).

::: {#fig-integrate layout="[-5, 30, 30, 30, -5]"}
![](figures/embeddings/identity/identity){#fig-identity}

![](figures/embeddings/interval/interval){#fig-interval}

![](figures/embeddings/integer/integer){#fig-integer}

Many spaces naturally embed into a real line, including (a) that real
line, (b) intervals of that real line, and (c) integers.
:::

The existence of an embedding map can be interpreted in a few different
ways.  On one hand it implies that $X$ is isomorphic to some subset of a
real line, if not an entire real line, which allows us to interpret $X$
as that subset.  Alternatively we can think of an embedding map as
assigning to each element $x \in X$ a numerical _position_ that we can
use to characterize geometric behavior.  Both interpretations are useful
but in this section we will lean heavily on this latter perspective.

When an embedding map is measurable with respect to the ambient
$\sigma$-algebra and integrable with respect to the ambient measure it
defines an integrand.  Most embedding maps are measurable but
integrability is less dependable, and failures of integrability are
important in practice.

### The Mean

If an embedding function is an integrand then we can evaluate its
measure-informed integral, $\mathbb{I}_{\mu}[\iota]$.  The ultimate
utility of this measure-informed integral, however, depends on what
information about the ambient measure it extracts.

Interpreting $\mathbb{I}_{\mu}[\iota]$ is straightforward when $X$ is
finite, $\mathcal{X}$ is the full power set, and we can represent any
measure with a mass function.  In this case we can explicitly compute
the $\mathbb{I}_{\mu}[\iota]$ as a weighted sum of positions,
$$
\mathbb{I}_{\mu}[\iota] = \sum_{x \in X} \mu(x) \, \iota(x).
$$
The more measure that is allocated to an element the more strongly the
measure-informed integral is pulled towards the position of that
element.  In other words $\mathbb{I}_{\mu}[\iota]$ is one way to
quantify the position around which the measure $\mu$ concentrates,
defining a notion of _centrality_ for the measure $\mu$.

This interpretation does generalize to arbitrary spaces, although the
formal motivation is a bit more subtle because we can no longer
interpret measure-informed integrals as simple weighted sums.  Instead
consider a baseline position $r_{0} \in \mathbb{R}$ and the squared
distance function
\begin{alignat*}{6}
d_{r_{0}}^{2} :\; & X & &\rightarrow& \; &\mathbb{R}^{+}&
\\
& x & &\mapsto& & (\iota(x) - r_{0})^{2} &
\end{alignat*}
which quantifies how far the position of any point in the ambient space
is from that baseline position.

So long as $\iota : X \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is an embedding this
squared distance function will be measurable and will define a valid
integrand.  The measure-informed integral
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{I}_{\mu} \left[ d_{r_{0}}^{2} \right]
&=
\mathbb{I}_{\mu} \left[ (\iota - r_{0})^{2} \right]
\\
&=
\mathbb{I}_{\mu} \left[ \iota^{2} - 2 \, r_{0} \, \iota + r_{0}^{2} \right]
\\
&=
\mathbb{I}_{\mu} \left[ \iota^{2} \right]
-2 \, r_{0} \cdot \mathbb{I}_{\mu} \left[ \iota \right]
+ \mathbb{I}_{\mu} \left[ r_{0}^{2} \right]
\\
&=
\mathbb{I}_{\mu} \left[ \iota^{2} \right]
-2 \, r_{0} \cdot \mathbb{I}_{\mu} \left[ \iota \right]
+ r_{0}^{2}
\end{align*}
quantifies how diffusely the measure $\mu$ is allocated around $r_{0}$;
the larger the integral the less $\mu$ concentrates around $r_{0}$.

Consequently the baseline position $r_{0} \in \mathbb{R}$ with the
_smallest_ integrated squared distance should be, in some sense, the
position closest to where $\mu$ concentrates.  Because we're working
with continuous positions we can compute the baseline position that
minimizes the integrated squared distance using calculus methods even if
$X$ itself is not continuous.

In particular the minimum $r_{0}^{*}$ is given by setting the derivative
of the measure-informed integral,
\begin{align*}
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} r_{0} }
\mathbb{I}_{\mu} \left[ d_{r_{0}}^{2} \right]
&=
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} r_{0} }
\left( \mathbb{I}_{\mu} \left[ \iota^{2} \right]
-2 \, r_{0} \cdot \mathbb{I}_{\mu} \left[ \iota \right]
+ r_{0}^{2} \right)
\\
&=
-2 \, \mathbb{I}_{\mu} \left[ \iota \right]
+ 2 \, r_{0},
\end{align*}
to zero,
\begin{align*}
0
&= \left. \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} r_{0} }
\mathbb{I}_{\mu} \left[ d_{r_{0}}^{2} \right] \right|_{r_{0} = r_{0}^{*}}
\\
0
&=
-2 \, \mathbb{I}_{\mu} \left[ \iota \right]
+ 2 \, r_{0}^{*}
\\
2 \, r_{0}^{*}
&=
2 \, \mathbb{I}_{\mu} \left[ \iota \right]
\\
r_{0}^{*}
&=
\mathbb{I}_{\mu} \left[ \iota \right].
\end{align*}

In other words the measure-informed integral of the embedding function
$\mathbb{I}_{\mu} [ \iota ]$ is exactly the position that minimizes the
expected squared distance and, in that sense, is closest to the
concentration of $\mu$.  Note that if $X$ is not continuous, for example
if $X = \mathbb{Z}$, then this central position might fall between the
positions of the individual elements (@fig-mean).

![The measure-informed integral of an embedding function,
$\mathbb{I}_{\mu} [ \iota ]$, is a continuous value even when the
ambient space is discrete.  In these cases the centrality of a measure
can fall "between" the individual elements.](
figures/mean/mean){
width=70% #fig-mean}

Because $\mathbb{I}_{\mu} \left[ \iota \right]$ quantifies a sense of
the centrality of the measure $\mu$ is referred to as the **mean** of
$\mu$, in reference to the "middle" of the measure.  When space is at a
premium I will use $\mathbb{M}_{\mu}$ to denote the mean, with the
ambient space and embedding map all implicit.

### Higher-Order Moments and Cumulants

We have not yet, however, exhausted the usefulness of an embedding map.
For example the integrated squared distance from the mean
$$
\mathbb{I}_{\mu} \bigg[ d_{\mathbb{M}_{\mu}}^{2} \bigg]
=
\mathbb{I}_{\mu} \bigg[ (\iota - \mathbb{M}_{\mu})^{2} \bigg]
$$
quantifies how _strongly_ $\mu$ concentrates around its centrality; the
larger the measure-informed integral the more diffuse the concentration
is.  This is known as the **variance** of $\mu$.

Higher-powers extract even more information.  For example the
measure-informed integral of the cubic integrand
$$
\mathbb{I}_{\mu} \left[ (\iota - \mathbb{M}_{\mu})^{3} \right]
$$
characterizes how _symmetric_ the concentration of $\mu$ is around its
centrality.

The many measure-informed integral that we can construct from an
embedding function can be systemized in various ways.  For example the
direct powers
$$
\mathbb{M}_{\mu, k} = \mathbb{I}_{\mu} \left[ \iota^{k} \right]
$$
define the $k$-th order **moments** while the shifted powers
$$
\mathbb{D}_{\mu, k} =
\mathbb{I}_{\mu} \left[ (\iota - \mathbb{M}_{\mu})^{k} \right]
$$
define the $k$-th order **central moments**.  In some cases normalizing
the central moments,
$$
\mathbb{N}_{\mu, k} =
\frac{ \mathbb{I}_{\mu} \left[ (\iota - \mathbb{M}_{\mu})^{k} \right] }
{ (\mathbb{D}_{\mu, 2})^{k / 2} }
=
\frac{ \mathbb{I}_{\mu} \left[ (\iota - \mathbb{M}_{\mu})^{k} \right] }
{ \left(
    \mathbb{I}_{\mu} \left[ (\iota - \mathbb{M}_{\mu})^{2} \right]
  \right)^{k / 2} },
$$
to give $k$-th order **standardized central moments** is also useful.

While straightforward to construct, higher-order moments can be tricky
to interpret.  More useful information can often be isolated by
carefully mixing a higher-order moment with lower-order moments,
resulting in **cumulants**, $\mathbb{C}_{\mu, k}$.  The general
construction of cumulants is complicated, with some very interesting but
very elaborate connections to combinatorics, but in this book we'll
focus on the first few cumulants.  Conveniently the first-order cumulant
is just the mean,
$$
\mathbb{C}_{\mu, 1} = \mathbb{M}_{\mu, 1},
$$
the second-order cumulant is just the variance,
$$
\mathbb{C}_{\mu, 2} = \mathbb{D}_{\mu, 2},
$$
and the third-order cumulant is just the third-order central moment,
$$
\mathbb{C}_{\mu, 3} = \mathbb{D}_{\mu, 3}.
$$
Beyond third-order the cumulants begin deviate away from the central
moments.

### Spaces Without Moments

Well-defined moments can be obstructed in three different ways.  Firstly
an isometric injection from the ambient space into a real line might not
exist.  Secondly if an isometric injection does exist then it needs to
be not only $\mathcal{X}$-measurable but also $\mu$-integrable.  In
practice measurability is almost never an issue on finite dimensional
ambient spaces, but we do need to take care to check existence and
integrability to avoid nonsensical results.

Consider, for example, a circular ambient space $X = \mathbb{S}^{1}$
equipped with a metric that assigns distances based on the angle spanned
by any two points.  We can construct an injective real-valued function
$f : \mathbb{S}^{1} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ by first cutting the circle
at any point, unrolling it into the half-open interval $(0, 2 \pi]$, and
then mapping the half-open interval into the entire real line.

Unfortunately any function constructed this way will not be isometric;
two points $x_{1}, x_{2} \in \mathbb{S}^{1}$ around the cut will be
close to each other in the circle but are mapped into points
$y_{1}, y_{2} \in (0, 2 \pi]$, and then $z_{1}, z_{2} \in \mathbb{R}$,
that are far apart from each other (@fig-no-circle-embedding).

![A circle $\mathbb{S}^{1}$ can be injectively mapped into a real line
$\mathbb{R}$ by first cutting the circle into a half-open interval
$(\theta_{0} - \pi, \theta_{0} + \pi]$ and then mapping the half-open
interval into a real line.  This mapping, however, is not isometric.
Two points $x_{1}, x_{2} \in \mathbb{S}^{1}$ around the cut will be
close to each other in the ambient space but map into points
$y_{1}, y_{2} \in (0, 2 \pi]$, and then $z_{1}, z_{2} \in \mathbb{R}$,
that are far from each other.  Without an isometric injection we cannot
define moments for any measure over a circle.](
figures/embeddings/circle/circle){
width=40% #fig-no-circle-embedding}

Ultimately one can use the topological incompatibility between the
circle and the real line that we first encountered in
[Chapter Two](https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/chapters_html/spaces.html)
to show that there is no way to construct _any_ isometry from the circle
$\mathbb{S}^{1}$ into a real line $\mathbb{R}$, let alone an injective
one.

This formal definition of moments is easy to dismiss as overly
technical.  Unfortunately the practical consequences are critical when
working with spaces like circles, spheres, torii, and more.  Many
analyses on these spaces have been undermined by attempts to summarize
measures with moments that don't actually exist!

All of this said we still have to take care with the necessary conditions
when working with more familiar spaces as well.  For example in
[Section 5.2.2](@sec:practical_lebesgue) we'll learn that the identify
function from a real line into itself is not integrable with respect to
the Lebesgue measure on a real line.  Consequently the Lebesgue measure
does not have a mean, let alone a variance or other higher-order
moments.

## Histograms

When the structure of the ambient space distinguishes certain subsets
the corresponding indicator functions become natural integrands to
consider.  Conveniently the measure-informed integrals of indicator
functions are also straightforward to interpret.

For example an ordering on the ambient space motivates interval subsets,
such as the half-open interval subsets
$$
( x_{1}, x_{2} ] = \{ x \in X \mid x_{1} < x \le x_{2} \}.
$$
We can then use disjoint intervals to study the behavior of a measure by
investigating how the measure allocations, or equivalently the
measure-informed integrals of the corresponding indicator functions,
vary across the ambient space.

More formally given the sequence of points
$$
\{ x_{1}, \ldots, x_{b}, \ldots, x_{B + 1} \} \in X
$$
we can partition the interval $(x_{1}, x_{B + 1})$ into a sequence of
$B$ disjoint half-open intervals,
\begin{align*}
\mathsf{b}_{1} &= ( x_{1}, x_{2} ]
\\
\mathsf{b}_{2} &= ( x_{2}, x_{3} ]
\\
\ldots&
\\
\mathsf{b}_{b} &= ( x_{b}, x_{b + 1} ]
\\
\ldots&
\\
\mathsf{b}_{B} &= ( x_{B}, x_{B + 1} ].
\end{align*}
Evaluating the measure-informed integral of the indicator function
corresponding to each these sub-intervals gives the allocated measure,
$$
\mathbb{I}_{\mu}[I_{\mathsf{b}_{b}}]
= \mu(\mathsf{b}_{b}).
$$

Each of these measure allocations can then be neatly visualized as a
rectangle, with the collection of measure allocations visualized as a
sequence of adjacent rectangles (@fig-histogram-basics).  This
visualization is referred to as a **histogram**, with the individual
intervals denoted **bins**.

![A histogram allows us to visualize the behavior of a measure over an
ordered space.  After partitioning a segment of the ambient space into
disjoint intervals, or bins, the measure allocated to each bin is
represented by a rectangle.](
figures/histograms/histogram/histogram){
width=60% #fig-histogram-basics}

Histograms are incredibly useful for quickly communicating some of the
key features of a measure (@fig-hist-examples).  For example histograms
allow us to differentiate between allocations that concentrate around a
point, referred to as **unimodal** measures, or even allocations that
concentrate around multiple points, referred to as **multimodal**
measures.  At the same time we can see _how_ a measure concentrates
around a point, for example whether the concentrations is symmetric or
skewed towards smaller or larger values.

::: {#fig-hist-examples layout="[ [-10, 40, 40, -10], [-10, 40, 40, -10] ]"}
![](figures/histograms/varying_behaviors/diffuse/diffuse){#fig-hist-diffuse}

![](figures/histograms/varying_behaviors/unimodal/unimodal){#fig-hist-unimodal}

![](figures/histograms/varying_behaviors/unimodal_skewed/unimodal_skewed){#fig-hist-unimodal}

![](figures/histograms/varying_behaviors/multimodal/multimodal){#fig-hist-multimodal}

Histograms are extremely effective at communicating the basic features of
a measure.  The measure in (a) is diffuse but decaying, allocating more
measure at smaller points than larger points.  Conversely the measure in
(b) concentrates around a single point while the measure in (c)
concentrates around multiple, distinct points.  Finally the measure in
(d) concentrates around a single point, but that concentration is
strongly asymmetric unlike the concentration in (b).
:::

The smaller the bins the finer the features we can resolve but the
more measure-informed integrals we have to compute in order to construct
the histogram (@fig-hist-binning).  In practice we have to choose a
binning that is suited to each measure of interest without being too
expensive to implement.

![A histogram with a finer binning communicates more detail about a
given measure, but also requires the computation of more
measure-informed integrals and hence is more expensive to construct.
Here as we use smaller bins we start to resolve a small side mode.  Note
that as we decrease the bins we also decrease the allocated measures,
and hence the height of each rectangle.  Here the heights are scaled to
accommodate the smaller measures and make the comparison between the
histograms easier.](
figures/histograms/varying_binning/varying_binning){
width=90% #fig-hist-binning}

The practical limitation of a finite number of bins also requires care
in how we choose the boundaries of a histogram.  Because a histogram
censors any behavior below $x_{1}$ and above $x_{B + 1}$ we need to
choose the binning to span all of the behaviors of interest.  For
example if the ambient measure allocations decay towards smaller and
larger values then we can set the bin boundaries to where the
allocations start to become negligible.

On discrete measure spaces we can always tune the bins in a histogram to
span only a single element.  In this case the height of each bin reduces
to $\mu( \{ x \} )$ and the resulting histogram reduces to a
visualization of the mass function.

## Cumulative Distribution Functions

On an ordered space we can also use interval subsets to visualize how
the total measure is allocated as we go from smaller values to larger
values.  More concretely consider the interval subsets consisting of all
points smaller than or equal to a given point,
$$
\mathsf{I}_{x} = \{ x' \in X \mid x' \le x \}.
$$
The measure allocated to these interval subsets quantifies how the
measure accumulates as we scan across the space,
\begin{alignat*}{6}
M :\; & X & &\rightarrow& \; &[0, \mu(X)]&
\\
& x & &\mapsto& & M_{\mu}(x) = \mu(\mathsf{I}_{x}) = \mathbb{I}_{\mu}[I_{\mathsf{I}_{x}}] &.
\end{alignat*}
This mapping is known as a
**cumulative distribution function** (@fig-cdf-basics).

![A cumulative distribution function quantifies how measure is allocated
to expanding intervals on an ordered space.  At the lower boundary of
the space the interval contains no points and the cumulative
distribution function returns zero.  As we move towards larger values
the interval expands, accumulating more and more measure.  Finally at
the upper boundary of the space the interval asymptotes to the total
measure.](
figures/cdfs/cdf/cdf){
width=50% #fig-cdf-basics}

Cumulative distribution functions are also sometimes written as
$\mu([x' < x])$ or even $\mu(x' < x)$.  Personally I find these
notations to be a bit too confusing as it's easy to mistake which
variable denotes points in the interval and which variable defines the
upper boundary of the interval itself.

By construction if $x_{1} < x_{2}$ then
$\mathsf{I}_{x_{1}} \subset \mathsf{I}_{x_{2}}$.  Consequently
$$
\mu(\mathsf{I}_{x_{1}}) \le \mu(\mathsf{I}_{x_{2}})
$$
or, equivalently,
$$
M(x_{1}) \le M(x_{2}).
$$
In other words every cumulative distribution function is a monotonically
non-decreasing function that begins at $0$ and ends at $\mu(X)$.

The precise shape of this non-decreasing accumulation conveys many
features of the ambient measure.  For example if the measure
concentrates around a single point then the cumulative distribution
function will rapidly increase around that point, increasing only slowly
before and after (@fig-cdf-unimodal).  In general the faster the
cumulative distribution function increases the stronger the
concentration will be (@fig-cdf-narrow-unimodal).  Similarly if there
are any gaps in the allocation, intermediate intervals with zero
allocated measure, then the cumulative distribution function will
flatten out completely (@fig-cdf-gap).

::: {#fig-cdf-examples layout="[-5, 30, 30, 30, -5]"}
![](figures/cdfs/cdf_behaviors/unimodal/unimodal){#fig-cdf-unimodal}

![](figures/cdfs/cdf_behaviors/narrow_unimodal/narrow_unimodal){#fig-cdf-narrow-unimodal}

![](figures/cdfs/cdf_behaviors/gap/gap){#fig-cdf-gap}

A careful survey of a cumulative distribution function can communicate a
wealth of information about the ambient measure.  (a) Here the ambient
measure is unimodal with the cumulative distribution function
appreciably increasing only once we reach the central neighborhood
where the measure allocation is concentrated.  (b)  A narrower
concentration results in a steeper cumulative distribution function.
(c)  A cumulative distribution function flattens if there are any gaps
in the measure allocation.  Here the measure concentrates around two
points separated by null interval $\mathsf{n}$ in between.
:::

One really nice feature of cumulative distribution functions is that
they allow us to compute explicit interval probabilities.  The union of
any two-sided, half-open interval
$$
( x_{1}, x_{2} ] = \{ x \in X \mid x_{1} < x \le x_{2} \}
$$
with the disjoint one-sided interval $\mathbb{I}_{x_{1}}$ defines
another one-sided interval,
$$
\mathsf{I}_{x_{2}} = \mathsf{I}_{x_{1}} \cup (x_{1}, x_{2}].
$$
Because measure allocations are additive this implies that
\begin{align*}
\mu(\mathsf{I}_{x_{2}})
&= \mu( \, \mathsf{I}_{x_{1}} \cup (x_{1}, x_{2}] \, )
\\
&= \mu(\mathsf{I}_{x_{1}}) + \mu( \, (x_{1}, x_{2}] \, )
\end{align*}
or
\begin{align*}
\mu(\mathsf{I}_{x_{2}})
&=
\mu(\mathsf{I}_{x_{1}}) + \mu( \, (x_{1}, x_{2}] \, )
\\
M(x_{2})
&=
M(x_{1}) + \mu( \, (x_{1}, x_{2}] \, )
\\
\mu( \, (x_{1}, x_{2}] \, )
&
= M(x_{2})  - M(x_{1}).
\end{align*}
In words the measure allocated to any half-open interval can be computed
by subtracting the cumulative distribution function outputs at the
interval boundaries (@fig-cdf-probs).

![The difference of cumulative distribution function outputs at two
points is equal to the measure allocated to the half-open interval
spanning those two points.  This allows us to calculate interval measure
allocations as needed.](
figures/cdfs/cdf_probs/cdf_probs){
width=90% #fig-cdf-probs}

If the measure allocated to every measurable subset
$\mathsf{x} \in \mathcal{X}$ can be derived from interval allocations
then a cumulative distribution function will provide enough information
to compute the measure allocated to every measurable subset.  In other
words the cumulative distribution function in this case _completely_
characterizes the measure, and it can be considered as alternative way
to define measures entirely.  Conveniently on every ordered measurable
space that we will encounter, such spaces of integers and real numbers
equipped with Borel $\sigma$-algebras, this will be true.

On an ordered, discrete measure space the cumulative distribution
function can be written as the sum of mass function evaluations,
\begin{align*}
M(x)
&= \mu(\{ x' \in X \mid x' \le x \})
\\
&= \sum_{x' \le x} \mu(x').
\end{align*}
Consequently mass functions and cumulative distribution functions
provide redundant information on these spaces (@fig-discrete-cdf).

![On ordered, discrete measure spaces a mass function and cumulative
distribution function provide equivalent, and hence redundant,
characterizations of a measure.](
figures/cdfs/discrete_cdf/discrete_cdf){
width=80% #fig-discrete-cdf}

Mass functions do not completely define a measure, however, on
ordered but uncountable spaces.  In this case a cumulative distribution
function can provide the information that the element-wise allocations
lack.  For example on a real line a continuous cumulative distribution
function defines a measure that allocates zero to every atomic subset
but still manages to accumulate finite measure as we scan through the
space.  Any jumps in a cumulative distribution function correspond to
individual elements that have been allocated non-zero measure
(@fig-cdf-jump).

![When the ambient space is ordered but uncountable and every atomic
subset is a null subset then the cumulative distribution function will
be continuous.  Any discontinuities in a cumulative distribution
function correspond to exceptional atomic subsets that have been
allocated finite measure.](
figures/cdfs/jump/jump){
width=60% #fig-cdf-jump}

## Quantiles

When a cumulative distribution function is bijective, mapping each point
$x \in X$ in the ambient space to a unique accumulated measure
$$
M(x) = \mu(\mathsf{I}_{x}) = \mathbb{I}_{\mu}[I_{\mathsf{I}_{x}}],
$$
we can invert it to map any accumulated measure to the point at which
that accumulation is achieved (@fig-quantile-function),
\begin{alignat*}{6}
q_{\mu} :\; & [0, \mu(X)] & &\rightarrow& \; &X&
\\
& m & &\mapsto& & M^{-1}(m) &.
\end{alignat*}
This inverse mapping is known as a **quantile function**.

![If a cumulative distribution function is invertible then its inverse
defines a quantile function that maps accumulated measures to the points
in the ambient space where the accumulation is reached.](
figures/quantiles/quantile_function/quantile_function){
width=80% #fig-quantile-function}

Because quantiles of probability distribution functions are particularly
useful in some applications they are often given explicit names.  For
example the point at which half of the total probability has been
accumulated,
$$
\Pi(x_{0.5}) = 0.5,
$$
is denoted the **median** of the probability distribution.  On spaces
where a mean is well-defined the median and mean complement each other
by quantifying slightly different notions of centrality.  Similarly the
points where a quarter of the probability has been accumulated and a
quarter of the probability remains,
\begin{align*}
\Pi(x_{0.25}) &= 0.25
\\
\Pi(x_{0.75}) &= 0.75,
\end{align*}
are known as the **quartiles**.

If the cumulative distribution function is not continuous then the
quantile function will not be well-defined.  For example on a countable
space the cumulative distribution function can achieve only a countable
number of accumulated measures.  Any intermediate value $m$ can be only
bounded below by the point $x_{m-}$ that achieves the largest
accumulated measure below $m$,
$$
x_{m-} = \underset{x \in X}{\mathrm{argmax}} M(x) < m,
$$
and bounded above by the point $x_{m+}$ that achieves the smallest
accumulated measure above $m$ (@fig-quantile-inverse-problems),
$$
x_{m+} = \underset{x \in X}{\mathrm{argmin}} M(x) > m.
$$

![Cumulative distribution functions on countable spaces are not
invertible.  Only a countable number of measure accumulations occur at
individual points; most measure accumulations occur "in between" the
countable points.](
figures/quantiles/inverse_problems/inverse_problems){
width=60% #fig-quantile-inverse-problems}

Many software packages implement _heuristic_ quantile functions that
either return $x_{m-}$ or $x_{m+}$ or interpolate between $x_{m-}$ and
$x_{m+}$ to provide a single value when the cumulative distribution
function is not invertible.  In this case different interpolation
strategies define different quantile functions.

# Explicit Measure-Informed Integrals

Up to this point our discussion of measure-informed integration has been
theoretical.  Given a measure $\mu$ we have shown that a linear map from
sufficiently nice, real-valued functions $f$ to real numbers
$\mathbb{I}_{\mu}[f] \in \mathbb{R}$ is well-defined.  We do not yet
know, however, how to _evaluate_ that map to give explicit
measure-informed integrals in practice.

Fortunately a few exceptional measures produce integrals that can be
computed from certain explicit mathematical operations that allow us to
realize them in practice.  In this section we'll review these
exceptional measures and their practical consequences.  Along the way
we'll also see how measure-informed integration relates to the Riemann
integral from calculus.

## Integration on Discrete Measure Spaces

Because they can be completely specified by a mass function, measure
allocations on discrete measure spaces are particularly straightforward
to implement in practice.  Conveniently measure-informed integrals on
these spaces are also completely specified by mass functions.

### Integration As Summation

For any discrete measurable space $(X, 2^{X})$ we can always decompose
a real-valued function into a sum of atomic indicator functions,
$$
f(x) = \sum_{x' \in X} f(x') \cdot I_{ \{ x' \} }(x).
$$
The integral with respect to any measure $\mu$ follows immediately by
applying linearity,
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{I}_{\mu}[f]
&\equiv
\mathbb{I}_{\mu} \left[ \sum_{x' \in X} f(x') \cdot I_{ \{ x' \} } \right]
\\
&=
\sum_{x' \in X} f(x') \cdot
\mathbb{I}_{\mu} \left[ I_{ \{ x' \} } \right],
\end{align*}
and then the definition of measure-informed integrals for indicator
functions,
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{I}_{\mu}[f]
&=
\sum_{x' \in X} f(x') \cdot
\mathbb{I}_{\mu} \left[ I_{ \{ x' \} } \right]
\\
&=
\sum_{x' \in X} f(x') \cdot \mu( \{ x' \} ).
\end{align*}

Consequently measure-informed integrals with respect to _any_
real-valued function on discrete measure spaces reduces to summations
which we can compute explicitly.  Moreover because the summations are
informed by only the measure allocations to atomic subsets they can be
computed using only the mass function and not the entire measure.

If $X$ is not only countable but also finite then the general definition
of measure-informed integral reduces to the heuristic construction that
we considered in [Section 1](@finite_expectation).

### Practical Consequences

When $X$ is finite we can implement the summation given by any
measure-informed integral by directly looping over each integrand
outputs.  Unfortunately this approach becomes unfeasible if $X$ contains
a countably infinite number of elements.

Some infinite sums do enjoy closed-form solutions; for all other sums
we cannot evaluate the corresponding measure-informed integral exactly.
That said we may be able to _approximate_ them by summing over only a
finite number of elements where both $\mu(x)$ and $f(x)$ are large.  The
more terms we include, the better these finite sums will approximate the
exact measure-informed integrals.

Consider, for example, the counting measure that allocates unit measure
to each atomic subset,
$$
\chi( \{x \}) = 1.
$$
More generally the counting measure allocates measure by counting the
number of elements contained in a given subset,
$$
\chi( \mathsf{x} ) = \sum_{x \in \mathsf{x}} 1.
$$

The integral of any real-valued function $f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$
with respect to counting measure is given by summing over all of the
output values,
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{I}_{\chi}[f]
&=
\int \chi( \mathrm{d} x) \, f(x)
\\
&=
\sum_{x \in X} \chi(\{ x \}) \cdot f(x)
\\
&=
\sum_{x \in X} 1 \cdot f(x)
\\
&=
\sum_{x \in X} f(x).
\end{align*}
In other words all integrals with respect to the counting measure can be
implemented by simply summing over the integrand outputs.

We can scale the counting measure by a positive function
$g : X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{+}$ following the strategy introduced in
[Section 3.2](@sec:scaling_measures).  The scaled measure $g \cdot \chi$
is implicitly defined by the integrals
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{I}_{g \cdot \chi}[f]
&=
\mathbb{I}_{\chi}[g \cdot f]
\\
&=
\sum_{x \in X} \chi( \{ x \}) \cdot \left( g(x) \cdot f(x) \right)
\\
&=
\sum_{x \in X} \left( g(x) \cdot \chi( \{ x \} ) \right) \cdot f(x).
\end{align*}
Consequently $g \cdot \chi$ can be implemented by simply scaling the
element-wise allocations,
$$
(g \cdot \chi)( \{ x \} ) = g(x) \cdot \chi( \{ x \} ).
$$
While this might have seemed obvious from the start, the machinery of
measure-informed integration allows us to prove that this intuitive
definition is consistent with how measure theory behaves more generally.

## Integration on Real Lines { #sec:integration_on_R }

Frustratingly there are no universal strategies for directly evaluating
measure-informed integrals on uncountable spaces.  Sometimes, however,
the structure of an uncountable space allow us to reduce
measure-informed integrals to more feasible mathematical operations.  In
particular measure-informed integrals with respect to the Lebesgue
measure on a real line can be related to the familiar Riemann integral
from calculus.

### Lebesgue Verses Riemann

By definition the measure-informed integral of an indicator function is
given by the measure allocated to the defining subset,
$$
\mathbb{I}_{\mu}[I_{\mathsf{x}}] = \mu(\mathsf{x}).
$$
On a real line $(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{R}})$ the Lebesgue
measure allocated to any interval is just the distance between the end
points,
$$
\lambda( \, [x_{1}, x_{2}] \, ) = d(x_{1}, x_{2}) = | x_{2} - x_{1} |.
$$
Consequently the Lebesgue integral of an interval indicator function is
given by
$$
\mathbb{I}_{\lambda}[I_{[x_{1}, x_{2}]}]
=
| x_{2} - x_{1} |.
$$
That integral, however, also happens to be the area under the curve
defined by the corresponding indicator function
(@fig-indicator-area),
\begin{align*}
\text{area}
&= \text{height} \cdot \text{length}
\\
&= 1 \cdot | x_{2} - x_{1} |
\\
&= \mathbb{I}_{\lambda}[I_{[x_{1}, x_{2}]}].
\end{align*}

This geometric coincidence also generalizes to simple functions.  The
area under the curve defined by a simple function built from a single
interval
$$
s(x) = \phi \cdot I_{[x_{1}, x_{2}]}
$$
is just
\begin{align*}
\text{area}
&= \text{height} \cdot \text{length}
\\
&= \phi \cdot | x_{2} - x_{1} |
\\
&= \phi \cdot \mathbb{I}_{\lambda}[I_{[x_{1}, x_{2}]}]
\\
&= \mathbb{I}_{\lambda}[\phi \cdot I_{[x_{1}, x_{2}]}]
\\
&= \mathbb{I}_{\lambda}[s].
\end{align*}
More generally the area under the curve defined by a simple function
built from many intervals
$$
s(x) = \sum_{j} \phi_{j} \cdot I_{[x_{1, j}, x_{2, j}]}
$$
is built up from rectangles defined by each component,
\begin{align*}
\text{area}
&= \sum_{j} \text{area}_{j}
\\
&= \sum_{j} \text{height}_{j} \cdot \text{length}_{j}
\\
&= \sum_{j} \phi_{j} \cdot | x_{2, j} - x_{1, j} |
\\
&= \sum_{j} \mathbb{I}_{\lambda}[\phi_{j} \cdot I_{[x_{1, j}, x_{2, j}]}].
\end{align*}
By linearity, however, this is just the measure-informed integral of the
simple function itself (@fig-simple-area)
\begin{align*}
\text{area}
&=
\sum_{j} \mathbb{I}_{\lambda}[\phi_{j} \cdot I_{[x_{1, j}, x_{2, j}]}]
\\
&=
\mathbb{I}_{\lambda}[\sum_{j} \phi_{j} \cdot I_{[x_{1, j}, x_{2, j}]}]
\\
&= \mathbb{I}_{\lambda}[s].
\end{align*}

::: {#fig-integrate layout="[-5, 45, 45, -5]"}
![](figures/integration/lebesgue_indicator/lebesgue_indicator){#fig-indicator-area}

![](figures/integration/lebesgue_simple/lebesgue_simple){#fig-simple-area}

Integrals of simple functions with respect to the Lebesgue measure are
intimately related to the area under the curve defined by simple
functions.  (a) The area under the curve defined by an interval
indicator function is equal to the height, $1$, times the length of the
interval.  That, however, is just equal to the Lebesgue integral of the
indicator function itself.  (b) The area under the curve defined by
interval simple functions is built up from the area of rectangles
defined by each component indicator function.  The total area is equal
to the Lebesgue integral of the simple function itself.
:::

Decomposing the positive and negative parts of a measurable, real-valued
function into simple functions pushes this relationship further.  On
one hand we can use the decomposition to define Lebesgue integrals, and
on the other we can use it to compute the area under the curve defined
by any sufficiently nice function (@fig-lebesgue).

We can also use classic calculus to compute the same area under the
curve. A Riemann integral is defined by partitioning the real line into
equally-sized intervals and then constructing rectangles from the height
of the integrand at the end of each interval.  As the intervals length
$\delta$ becomes smaller and smaller the sum of the rectangle areas
converges to the area under the curve (@fig-riemann),
$$
\int \mathrm{d} x \, f(x)
=
\lim_{\delta \rightarrow 0}
\sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty} \delta \cdot f(x_{0} + n \cdot \delta).
$$

::: {#fig-integrate layout="[ [-5, 90, -5], [-5, 90, -5] ]"}
![](figures/integration/lebesgue/lebesgue){#fig-lebesgue}

![](figures/integration/riemann/riemann){#fig-riemann}

On a real line $X = \mathbb{R}$ integration with respect to the Lebesgue
measure and Riemann integration both quantify the area under a curve
defined by a sufficiently nice real-valued function
$f : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. (a) As we add more components
the Lebesgue integral of a simple function converges to the Lebesgue
integral of $f$.  At the same time the sum of the rectangular areas
defined by each component indicator function converges to the area under
the curve defined by $f$. (b) Riemann integration computes the area
under the curve as a sum of increasingly narrow rectangular areas, only
the rectangles are stacked horizontally instead of vertically.
:::

Geometrically Lebesgue integration computes the area under a curve by
summing over _vertically_ stacked rectangles while Riemann integration
computes the area by summing over _horizontally_ stacked rectangles.
Riemann integration doesn't always result in a well-defined answer, but
when it does we can use these two methods for computing the area under a
curve to relate integrals with respect to the Lebesgue measure to
classic integration!

More formally for any measurable and $\lambda$-integrable real-valued
function $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ we have
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{I}_{\lambda}[f]
&= \int \lambda( \mathrm{d} x) \, f(x)
\\
&= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \mathrm{d} x \, f(x)
\end{align*}
so long as the Riemann integral $\int \mathrm{d} x \, f(x)$ is
well-defined.  In other words Lebesgue integration on the real line
completely generalizes Riemann integration; measure-informed integration
then generalizes Lebesgue integration on the real line to arbitrary
meaures and spaces.

This particular equivalence is the motivation for the many alternative
notations that we discussed in [Section 2.4](@sec:alt_notations).  In
general the integral signs in those notations do not correspond to
the Riemann integral of calculus, but in the special case of the
Lebesgue measure over a real line they do!

### Practical Consequences { #sec:practical_lebesgue }

When a real-valued function has a well-defined Riemann integral then we
can apply the tools of calculus to evaluate Lebesgue integrals.  The
exceptional Riemann integrals that can be evaluated analytically allow
us to compute the corresponding Lebesgue integrals exactly.  More
generally we can use numerical integration techniques to approximate
the Riemann integrals, and hence approximately evaluate Lebesgue
integrals.

For example the measure-informed integral of an interval indicator
function is given by
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{I}_{\lambda}[I_{[x_{1}, x_{2}]}]
&=
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \mathrm{d} x \, I_{[x_{1}, x_{2}]}(x)
\\
&=
\int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}} \mathrm{d} x
\\
&=
x_{2} - x_{1},
\end{align*}
consistent with the definition of the Lebesgue measure.  Note that the
correct, positive answer required that we integrate from the lower end
of the interval to the upper end.  Changing the order defines the same
interval, and hence the same Lebesgue measure allocation, but it flips
the sign of the Riemann integral.  In order to properly relate Lebesgue
integrals to Riemann integrals we have to fix the _orientation_ of the
intervals.

Similarly the mean of a Lebesgue measure would be given by the integral
of the identity function,
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{I}_{\lambda}[\iota]
&=
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \mathrm{d} x \, \iota(x)
\\
&=
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \mathrm{d} x \, x
\\
&=
\left. \frac{1}{2} x^{2} \right|^{\infty}_{-\infty}
\\
&=
\infty - \infty.
\end{align*}
Unfortunately this result is ill-posed because $\infty$ minus itself is
consistent with _every_ value on the real line.  Had we been a bit more
careful, however, this would not have been surprising.  The problem is
that the identify function is not Lebesgue-integrable,
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{I}_{\lambda}[| \iota |]
&=
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \mathrm{d} x \, | \iota(x) |
\\
&=
2 \, \int_{0}^{\infty} \mathrm{d} x \, x
\\
&=
\left. x^{2} \right|^{\infty}_{0}
\\
&=
\infty!
\end{align*}
Consequently the Lebesgue measure does not have any well-defined
moments.

Likewise the scaling of the Lebesgue measure by a positive function
$g : X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{+}$ can be implemented with the integrals
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{I}_{g \cdot \lambda}[f]
&=
\mathbb{I}_{\lambda}[g \cdot f]
\\
&=
\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \mathrm{d} x \, g(x) \cdot f(x).
\end{align*}
In particular the measure allocated to any interval becomes
\begin{align*}
(g \cdot \lambda) ( \, [x_{1}, x_{2} ] \, )
&=
\mathbb{I}_{g \cdot \lambda} \big[ I_{ [x_{1}, x_{2}] } \big]
\\
&=
\mathbb{I}_{\lambda} \big[ g \cdot I_{ [x_{1}, x_{2}] } \big]
\\
&=
\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}
\mathrm{d} x \, g(x) \cdot I_{ [x_{1}, x_{2}] }(x)
\\
&=
\int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}} \mathrm{d} x \, g(x).
\end{align*}

By appropriately scaling the Lebesgue measure in this way we can
implement all kinds of measures over a real line, including most
probability distributions of practical interest.  We'll formalize this
procedure in the next chapter.

# Conclusion

Measure-informed integrals are the main way that we interact with
measures, both in theory and in practice.  Equivalently expectation
values are the main way that we can probe the behavior of probability
distributions.  Indeed a recurring theme in applying probability theory
in practice will be the principled computation of expectation values for
relevant expectands.

In the next chapter we'll learn how to extend the exceptionally explicit
integrals with respect to Lebesgue measures to a much larger class
of measures, including many probability distributions.  Later on we'll
learn some powerful _sampling_ techniques for directly estimating
expectation values for general probability distributions.
